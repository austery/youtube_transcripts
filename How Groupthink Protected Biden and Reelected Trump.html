        <h1>How Groupthink Protected Biden and Reelected Trump</h1>
        <h2>The Ezra Klein Show</h2>

        <div class="intro">
            <p class="english-text">This episode is about a seemingly simple question: Was there a Joe Biden cover-up? Like a lot of people, I was worried about Biden's age when he ran for president in 2020.</p>
            <p class="chinese-text">本期节目围绕一个看似简单的问题展开：乔·拜登是否存在掩盖行为？和许多人一样，我在2020年他竞选总统时就担心他的年龄。</p>
            <p class="english-text">Folks, the people of this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory. And so, like a lot of reporters, I found myself continuously asking top White House staffers during his presidency, "How's Joe Biden doing? What's he like in the meetings? How's his energy?" I always got the same answer: He's great. Completely in command. His energy is amazing. These are people I'd known for a long time. I don't think they were lying to me. The harder question in retrospect was whether they were lying to themselves. We all know the story from there. Biden's collapse in the presidential debate with the COVID, excuse me, with "um dealing with everything we have to do with uh look," the push to remove him from the ticket, the growing number of congressional Democrats who called on President Biden to step aside, Kamala Harris's sprint of a campaign, Donald Trump's return to the White House. Back when I and others were arguing that Biden shouldn't run again, it was seen as at the very least a contestable argument, maybe a crazy thing to be saying. In the last 6 months though, I've watched a new conventional wisdom solidify. One of the most powerful figures in the Democratic Party is putting the blame for Tuesday's historic loss on President Biden. Yes, of course, it would have been better for President Biden to have made that decision earlier. I think there's no question about it, and his close advisers shouldn't have told him to run again, and they shouldn't have told him he was going to win. Was there a cover-up? A cover-up would at least reveal a core of cold rationality to this system. It would mean that people dealing with Biden every single day, they knew the truth. They saw it clearly and decided to lie. That there were adults in the room, if only malign ones, in a way that would be more comforting than what I think actually happened. And so there are questions here that are relevant long beyond the Biden campaign. How do you see what is right in front of your eyes when you don't want to see it? How do you not let loyalty to a person, to a party, to a cause blind you? Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's new book, *Original Sin*, is a reconstruction of what Democrats should have known and when they should have known it. Thompson had covered Biden at Axios. Tapper is, of course, an anchor at CNN. He was co-moderator of that historic and for Biden disastrous presidential debate. So I asked Tapper on the show to talk through what they learned in the more than 200 interviews behind that book and what lessons we can take from it. And just to note, we taped this before the news of Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis. The episode isn't any less relevant. In fact, maybe it's more relevant. But of course, I want to say that we wish him well.</p>
            <p class="chinese-text">各位，这个国家的人民已经发声。他们为我们带来了明确的胜利，令人信服的胜利。因此，像许多记者一样，在拜登担任总统期间，我不断向白宫高级幕僚询问：“乔·拜登情况如何？他在会议中表现如何？他的精力怎么样？”我总是得到相同的答案：他很棒。完全掌控局面。他的精力惊人。这些人我认识很久了。我不认为他们在对我撒谎。回想起来，更难的问题是他们是否在对自己撒谎。我们都知道之后的故事。拜登在总统辩论中表现失常，用“咳咳，抱歉，呃，处理我们必须做的所有事情，呃，看”来回应，推动将他从竞选名单上移除，越来越多的国会民主党人呼吁拜登总统靠边站，卡玛拉·哈里斯的仓促竞选，唐纳德·特朗普重返白宫。当初我和其他人争论拜登不应该再次参选时，这至少被认为是一个有争议的论点，也许是个疯狂的说法。然而，在过去的6个月里，我目睹了一种新的传统观点逐渐形成。民主党最有影响力的人物之一正在将周二的历史性失败归咎于拜登总统。是的，当然，拜登总统早些时候做出那个决定会更好。我认为这毫无疑问，他的亲密顾问不应该告诉他再次参选，也不应该告诉他他会赢。是否存在掩盖行为？掩盖行为至少会揭示这个系统核心的冷酷理性。这意味着那些每天与拜登打交道的人，他们知道真相。他们清楚地看到了，并决定撒谎。房间里有成年人，即便只是恶意的成年人，这在某种程度上会比我认为实际发生的情况更令人欣慰。因此，这里的问题远远超出了拜登的竞选。当你不想看到它时，你如何才能看到眼前的事物？你如何不让对一个人、一个政党、一项事业的忠诚蒙蔽你的双眼？杰克·塔珀和亚历克斯·汤普森的新书《原罪》是对民主党人应该知道什么以及何时应该知道的重构。汤普森曾在Axios报道拜登。塔珀当然是CNN的主播。他是那场对拜登来说具有历史性且灾难性的总统辩论的联合主持人。所以我邀请塔珀上节目，谈谈他们通过200多次采访学到了什么，以及我们可以从中吸取什么教训。请注意，我们在乔·拜登被诊断出癌症的消息公布前录制了这期节目。这期节目并没有因此变得不相关。事实上，也许更相关。但当然，我想说我们祝他早日康复。</p>

                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Thank you. I want to start a bit in the middle. You tell the story of Special Prosecutor Robert Hur's interviews with Biden in a lot more detail than I'd heard it before. I think people know that report comes out and the prosecutor calls Biden a sort of well-meaning old man with a flagging memory. Something like that.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">谢谢。我想从中间开始说起。你讲述了特别检察官罗伯特·赫尔采访拜登的故事，比我之前听到的要详细得多。我想人们都知道那份报告出来了，检察官称拜登是一个“好心但记忆力衰退的老人”。差不多是这个意思。</p>
            </div>

                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Yeah. But which is nice, by the way. It's a nice description. That's not a mean description. That's an accurate, nice description. He could have been...</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。顺便说一句，这很好。这是一个很好的描述。这不是一个刻薄的描述。这是一个准确而友善的描述。他本可以……</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Well, at the moment it was taken as a very mean description. It was.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，当时它被认为是一个非常刻薄的描述。确实如此。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Yeah. So, what was going on behind that description?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。那么，这个描述背后发生了什么？</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Well, I think for Robert Hur and the prosecutors, they were legitimately flabbergasted by how President Biden appeared in that deposition, in the interview in October 2023. They were stunned. And I think they legitimately debated how he would appear to a jury that I think they legitimately thought, "If there's even one person that sees him the way that we see him, which is addled, we're not going to be able to get a conviction."</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，我认为对罗伯特·赫尔和检察官来说，他们确实被拜登总统在2023年10月的证词和采访中的表现震惊了。他们目瞪口呆。我认为他们确实认真讨论了他将如何呈现在陪审团面前，他们真诚地认为：“如果哪怕有一个人像我们一样看他，觉得他思维混乱，我们就无法获得定罪。”</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">I mean, what was happening in those conversations that he seemed so addled?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我的意思是，那些谈话中发生了什么，让他显得如此思维混乱？</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Well, if you read the transcript of the Hur interview, he is just meandering, unable to focus on the train of thought. He doesn't know dates. He's asked about a period that's significant for the investigation about, you know, his holding and sharing information that is of a classified nature. So, 2017, 2018. And first of all, he thinks that it is around the time that Bo died and that Bo was deployed, and it's not. Bo died in 2015, and Bo had been deployed years before that. And then second of all, he's just unable to place events.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，如果你读赫尔采访的笔录，他只是漫无目的，无法集中思绪。他不知道日期。他被问及一个对调查很重要的时期，关于他持有和分享机密信息。那是2017年、2018年。首先，他以为那是博去世和博被部署的时候，但事实并非如此。博于2015年去世，博在多年前就被部署了。其次，他根本无法确定事件的发生时间。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Joe Biden (quoted):</span>
                <p class="english-text">And film gets elected in November of 2017. 2016. 16. 2016. All right. So, why do I have 2017? Yeah. That's when you left office January of 2017. Okay. Um, but that's when Trump gets sworn in. Yeah.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">然后（他）在2017年11月当选。2016。16年。2016年。好吧。那为什么我记成2017年呢？是的。那是你2017年1月卸任的时候。好的。嗯，但那是特朗普宣誓就职的时候。是的。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">It's beyond just an avuncular, charming Irish pal sharing anecdotes. It's a meandering old man. And in 2017, Bo had passed. And this is personal. The genesis of the book and the title, "Promise Me, Dad" was a uh I know you're all close with your sons and daughters, but Bo was like my right arm and was my left. These guys were a year and a day apart, and they could finish each other's sentences. And Bo, I used to go home on the train, and the period that I was still in the Senate anyway. And while he got assailed Robert Hur as a partisan hack out to destroy Biden, my conclusion, and the conclusion of Attorney General Merrick Garland, by the way, was far from that. My read of how people reacted to that document was it was a suspicion that Hur was trying to find a middle path, that he didn't want to prosecute the president, and so he sort of dinged him on memory so the right could feel good about that. I think people understood that as a political document.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">这已经超越了一个慈祥、迷人的爱尔兰老朋友分享轶事。他是一位漫无目的的老人。而2017年，博已经去世了。这是私事。这本书的由来和书名《答应我，爸爸》是，呃，我知道你们都和自己的儿女很亲近，但博就像我的右臂，也是我的左臂。他们俩只相差一年零一天，可以互相补全句子。而博，我以前常常坐火车回家，那时候我还在参议院。虽然罗伯特·赫尔被攻击为是一个旨在摧毁拜登的党派黑客，但我的结论，顺便说一句，也是司法部长梅里克·加兰的结论，远非如此。我对人们对那份文件反应的解读是，大家怀疑赫尔试图寻找一条中间道路，他不想起诉总统，所以他就在记忆力上给他一点打击，这样右翼就会觉得满意。我认为人们把那份文件理解为一份政治文件。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">When you read those transcripts though, and you produce some of them in the book, the sense that the President of the United States is actually appearing too forgetful to be convicted of a crime that requires intent, in front of a jury, is a much more extraordinary and damning thing. And in retrospect, it makes the reaction to the Hur report look much too modest because I think people assumed it wasn't quite on the level. I think it was on the level.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">然而，当你读那些笔录，并在书中展示其中一部分时，美国总统实际上看起来记忆力太差，无法在陪审团面前被判犯有需要意图的罪行，这种感觉要非同寻常得多，也更具毁灭性。事后看来，这使得对赫尔报告的反应显得过于温和，因为我认为人们当时认为它不完全是真实的。但我认为它是真实的。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">The pushback was interesting because the pushback was not about, "Well, the there was the White House pushback," which was not about, "Hey, the president broke the law," which is how people, by the way, how prosecutors at DOJ thought it was going to be received. They thought the White House is going to be like, "Crap, the president broke the law," but the pushback was not on that, but that he was old, which I think is the tell from the White House. And the White House went to war not just against Robert Hur, they went to war against their own Attorney General, Merrick Garland. And Garland comes to the conclusion, and this is in our book, that ultimately Biden, even though he brought him on board saying he wanted a fair, just Attorney General and a Justice Department that had no fear or favor for anyone, Garland ultimately came to the conclusion that's not what he wanted. That's not what Biden wanted. Biden did not want an independent Justice Department. He wanted one that would protect him and his son.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">这次反弹很有趣，因为反弹不是关于“白宫的反弹是关于总统是否违法”，这倒是司法部检察官原以为会遇到的反应。他们以为白宫会说“糟糕，总统违法了”，但反弹并不是这个，而是说他老了，我认为这是白宫的自露马脚。白宫不仅与罗伯特·赫尔开战，他们甚至与自己的司法部长梅里克·加兰开战。加兰最终得出结论，这在我们的书中也有记载，那就是拜登虽然当初任命他时说希望有一个公正无私的司法部长和司法部，但加兰最终得出结论，那并非拜登真正想要的。拜登不想要一个独立的司法部。他想要一个能够保护他和他儿子的司法部。</p>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">So, I have this weird experience with this, which I happen to be at the White House on the day the Hur report comes out. And I'm there doing a bunch of other reporting. But one of the things I'm there working on is a story that in my head at that moment is titled, "Is Joe Biden up to this?" because he'd been doing basically no interviews, not really doing press conferences. We had no real evidence that he was capable of the rigors of campaigning at that point. And then they decided not to do the Super Bowl interview. Which for me was some kind of very big tell. Like that was a moment when I really shifted.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">所以，我对此有一个奇怪的经历，就是我在赫尔报告发布的那天正好在白宫。我在那里做很多其他报道。但我当时正在做的一件事，在我脑海中题为“乔·拜登能胜任吗？”因为他基本上没怎么接受采访，也没怎么召开记者会。我们当时没有真正的证据表明他能够胜任竞选的严酷。然后他们决定不进行超级碗采访。对我来说，那是一个非常大的迹象。就像那个时刻，我真的改变了看法。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">You have a different explanation than they ever gave me on why they didn't do the Super Bowl interview. Why?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">你有一个和他们给我的不同的解释，关于他们为什么不进行超级碗采访。为什么？</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Well, first of all, laid across all of this is the fact that he's not capable of doing good interviews as of 2023, period. They don't do the Super Bowl interview the year before either. They blame that on it being Fox, but they don't do it. They told me actually it's because they knew that Hur report was about to drop, and they knew it would have all this stuff about classified information and about him seeming super old behind the scenes and addled behind the scenes, and they didn't want to have an interview on that. No matter with whom and no matter what the format was going to be, they didn't want 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes about what it would have been: "Oh my God, this Hur report says that you're not up to the task." The Hur interview comes out, Biden seems himself authentically furious, and they call a press conference. It happens late that night. I remember being in my hotel room after being at the White House all day watching this press conference. In addition, I know there's some attention paid to some language and report about my recollection of events. There's even reference that I don't remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn't any of their damn business.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，首先，所有这一切的基础事实是，截至2023年，他根本无法做好采访。句号。他们前一年也没有进行超级碗采访。他们把那归咎于福克斯，但他们就是没做。他们实际上告诉我，那是因为他们知道赫尔报告即将发布，他们知道报告里会有所有关于机密信息和他私下看起来非常老态、思维混乱的内容，他们不想就此进行采访。无论和谁采访，无论采访形式如何，他们都不想花10分钟、15分钟、20分钟来谈论本来会是这样的内容：“天哪，这份赫尔报告说你无法胜任。”赫尔采访出来后，拜登似乎真的非常愤怒，他们召开了新闻发布会。那天晚上很晚才发生。我记得我一整天都在白宫，然后回到酒店房间看这场新闻发布会。此外，我知道报告中有些语言引起了关注，关于我对事件的回忆。甚至提到我记不起儿子何时去世。他凭什么敢提出这个？坦率地说，当被问到这个问题时，我心想，这根本不关他们的事。</p>

As you know, initially the President of Mexico, Sisi, did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in. I talked to him. I convinced him open the gate. For me, like that was the moment when I realized, okay, it went from the question mark like, "Can he do this?" to "He can't," right? If you can't go out and not have a memory flub in the press conference about your memory, you're in real trouble.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。在这场旨在安抚人们关于他记忆力的采访中，他把埃及和墨西哥搞混了。如你所知，最初墨西哥总统塞西不想打开大门让救援物资进入。我跟他谈过。我说服他打开了大门。对我来说，那一刻我意识到，好吧，事情从“他能做到吗？”的问号变成了“他不能”，对吗？如果你在关于你记忆力的新闻发布会上都无法避免记忆出错，那你就真的有麻烦了。</p>

                <p class="english-text">And look, I can't imagine the grief he feels about Beau or his first wife and daughter. And that's also one of the subtexts of this book, obviously, or texts in this book, is that the two main areas where we think, according to top aides, that his diminishment happened the most, had to do with times of extreme stress for Hunter, in the summer of 2023, when the plea deal fell apart, and then the summer of 2024, when he was convicted of a crime in a Delaware jury. Because in Joe Biden's brain, understandably, he thought there was a very real fear he was going to lose a third child, that Hunter was going to either overdose or commit suicide. And I'm not saying that as an excuse. I'm not saying that lightly, but I'm just saying this is part of what happened. That stress helped really deteriorate his essence. I think those parts of the book are really persuasive and sad.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">听着，我无法想象他为博或者他的第一任妻子和女儿所感受到的悲痛。当然，这也是这本书的一个潜台词，或者说书中的主要内容之一，就是根据高级助手的说法，他衰退最严重的两个主要领域，都与亨特在2023年夏天极度焦虑的时期有关，当时认罪协议破裂，然后是2024年夏天，他在特拉华州被陪审团判定有罪。因为在乔·拜登的脑海里，可以理解的是，他认为有一个非常真实的恐惧，他将失去第三个孩子，亨特要么吸毒过量，要么自杀。我这不是在找借口。我不是在轻描淡写，我只是说这是发生的一部分。那种压力确实帮助他的精气神严重衰退了。我认为书中的那些部分非常有说服力，也很令人悲伤。</p>

                <p class="chinese-text">他们中的一些人确实如此。至少我听到的那些人是。嗯，你没告诉我你听到了谁的说法，但我会告诉你，乔·拜登竞选连任所发生的这场灾难，以及对他幕后真实情况的掩盖，罗伯特·赫尔所看到的，都是由乔和吉尔、亨特、迈克·多尼伦和史蒂夫·里凯蒂策划的。还有其他一些人，程度轻一点，但那五个人负有最大的责任。</p>

                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">The cover-up, that's the word I want to get at here. One thing throughout this whole period and for years before it, which was always a bad sign, is like a lot of political reporters, I am asking people in the White House constantly, "How's Joe Biden in meetings? How's he doing?" And they all say fine to a person. The line you often hear is he can perform the presidency, but he can't, quote-unquote, "perform the presidency." His communication skills have degraded, but as a decision-maker, he's better than ever. And it keeps a lot of people from writing what's sort of in front of your face because you think, "Well, these people are seeing things I'm not," right? If they tell me he's good in the meetings, I don't know if he's good in the meetings, right? So, when you say there's a cover-up, my sense of these people is that they this is what they believed or at least had talked themselves into believing. Do you feel most people were seeing him in meetings and he came off the way he came off with Robert Hur and they're just not telling anybody, or is it something more psychologically complex going on here?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">掩盖，这是我在这里想强调的词。在这整个时期以及之前的几年里，一直有一个不好的迹象，就像许多政治记者一样，我不断地问白宫里的人：“乔·拜登在会议中表现如何？他怎么样？”他们都异口同声地说“很好”。你经常听到的一种说法是，他能履行总统职责，但他不能“表演总统职责”。他的沟通能力下降了，但作为决策者，他比以往任何时候都好。这让很多人不敢写出眼前的事实，因为你会想：“嗯，这些人看到了一些我没看到的东西，”对吗？如果他们告诉我他在会议中表现很好，我不知道他在会议中是否真的很好，对吗？所以，当你说存在掩盖行为时，我对这些人的感觉是，他们就是这么相信的，或者至少是说服自己相信的。你觉得大多数人在会议中看到他，他表现得和罗伯特·赫尔看到的一样，而他们只是不告诉任何人，还是这里面有更复杂的心理因素？</p>

                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Both. Yes, they were lying to themselves. They were lying to others. But it all, like the definition of a cover-up is when you are hiding something that is an ugly fact. And the ugly fact is that the Joe Biden that we all saw at the debate on June 27th, 2024 did not just step out of nowhere. That was Joe Biden. And that was the logical consequence of what they had been hiding since really, in a big way, since 2023. Look, I'm not saying that every meeting President Biden had, he came across as addled. What I am saying, what Alex Thompson and I, who he's my co-author, Alex Thompson from Axios, what we are asserting is that there was, as far back as 2019, a Biden that was fine, and then a non-functioning Biden. And that from 2019 to 2024, the non-functioning Biden would rear his head increasingly. And what do I mean by non-functioning? I mean losing his train of thought in a manner that's uncomfortable. I mean not able to come up with the names of top aids or close friends. I mean not recognizing people that he should recognize. I mean not able at all to communicate to the American people. And I think there's a degree to which, and this metaphor was used by so many White House aids we interviewed, the frog in the boiling water. I think there is a degree to which people as the water is increasingly turned up, they don't notice that it's getting hotter and hotter. And then we would hear from so many people who worked at the White House, then left and then came back 6 months later or turned on the TV 6 months later and they could not believe what they saw.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">两者兼有。是的，他们对自己撒谎。他们也对别人撒谎。但这都是，就像掩盖的定义一样，当你隐藏一个丑陋的事实。而这个丑陋的事实是，我们在2024年6月27日辩论中看到的那位乔·拜登并非凭空出现。那就是乔·拜登。那是他们自2023年以来一直大规模隐藏的逻辑结果。看，我不是说拜登总统的每一次会议都显得思维混乱。我所说的，以及我的合著者，Axios的亚历克斯·汤普森和我都主张的是，早在2019年，就有一个正常的拜登，然后是一个功能失调的拜登。而且从2019年到2024年，功能失调的拜登会越来越多地显现出来。我说的功能失调是什么意思？我的意思是，他会以一种令人不安的方式失去思路。我的意思是，他无法想起高级助手或亲密朋友的名字。我的意思是，他无法认出他应该认出的人。我的意思是，他根本无法与美国人民沟通。我认为在某种程度上，我们采访的许多白宫助手都用过这个比喻，就是“温水煮青蛙”。我认为在某种程度上，随着水温越来越高，人们没有注意到它越来越热。然后我们会听到许多在白宫工作过的人，他们离开了，然后六个月后回来或者六个月后打开电视，他们都不敢相信自己所看到的一切。</p>

His lack of empathy and compassion can be summed up in a phrase I suspect he's most proud of having made famous: "You're fired." I mean, really, I'm not joking. Think about that. Think about that. Think about everything you learned as a child. No matter where you were raised, how can there be pleasure in saying, "You're fired?" He's trying to tell us he cares about the middle class. Give me a break. That's a bunch of malarkey. 2020, I thought his communication problems were already clear. There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're making less than if you're a middle-class family, you're getting hurt badly right now.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">你看看2016年的大会，我觉得他发表了大会上最好的演讲。他缺乏同情心和怜悯心，可以概括为他最引以为豪的一句话：“你被解雇了。”我是说，真的，我不是开玩笑。想想看。想想看。想想你小时候学到的一切。无论你在哪里长大，说出“你被解雇了”怎么会有乐趣呢？他试图告诉我们他关心中间阶层。饶了我吧。那都是胡说八道。2020年，我认为他的沟通问题已经很明显了。他之所以提出这些胡说八道，是有原因的。他不想谈论实质性问题。这不是关于他的家庭和我的家庭。这是关于你的家庭，你的家庭现在正受到严重的伤害。如果你是一个中产阶级家庭，你的收入不如从前，你现在正受到严重的伤害。</p>

                <p class="english-text">Yeah. Do you want to talk through what that was? So his presidency starts off. He's still, you know, we're all still in COVID lockdown. People forget the degree to which 2021 is still part of COVID. And notecards and teleprompters are just standard procedure for him. They become crutches to the degree that Democrats are getting phone calls in 2023 because he's doing small fundraisers, 40, 50 people, and his campaign staff is demanding a teleprompter at one. We have a Chicago fundraiser where the host doesn't want to have a teleprompter there and they're like, "This is the price of admission," and Biden will walk in, read from the teleprompter, and walk out. Sometimes he'll do a photo line, sometimes he won't. But it's very odd, and it's very weird, and that's not what happens in these fundraisers. The whole point of these fundraisers, if you're giving huge money to a to the Democratic Party or to a pro-Biden Super PAC or whatever, is you are getting time with the stars of the of the event. And he's not really doing that in any comfortable degree. And he's making people feel very uncomfortable because why does he need a teleprompter to come in and talk for 10 minutes? Something that anybody in politics or the media should be able to do. Just talk for 10 minutes about whatever. And those become crutches to the degree that then they become also part of the cover-up, even if they didn't start out that way.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。你想谈谈那是什么吗？他的总统任期开始了。他仍然，你知道，我们都还在新冠封锁中。人们忘记了2021年多大程度上仍然是新冠的一部分。而他的手写卡片和提词器只是标准程序。它们变成了拐杖，以至于民主党人在2023年接到电话，因为他正在进行小规模的筹款活动，有40、50人，他的竞选团队要求在那里放置提词器。我们在芝加哥有一个筹款活动，主办方不想在那里放置提词器，但他们说：“这是入场费。”拜登会走进来，从提词器上读完，然后走出去。有时他会拍合照，有时不会。但这非常奇怪，也非常不寻常，这在这些筹款活动中是不应该发生的。这些筹款活动的重点，如果你向民主党或亲拜登的超级政治行动委员会捐赠大量资金，是为了让你能与活动中的明星人物相处。而他并没有真正舒适地做到这一点。他让人们感到非常不舒服，因为他为什么需要提词器来进来讲话10分钟？这是任何政治界或媒体界的人都应该能够做到的。只是随便说10分钟。而这些就变成了拐杖，以至于后来它们也成了掩盖的一部分，即使它们一开始并非如此。</p>

A cabinet secretary told us, "So he had a cabinet meeting in October 2023, and then he didn't have another one until like I think September 2024 after he had dropped out." Why would he keep the cabinet at bay? Why? We had a White House staffer say, somebody who left because they were so upset by what was going on, that there was a very purposeful decision to just limit his interactions with anybody who wasn't like in the Palipiro or a must-visit.</p>

Both physically and and probably mentally. I find myself stumbling a little bit more on the teleprompter than I did five or 10 years ago. It just happens. It's just part of aging. I only say this because I'm aware of my limitations. I don't believe that Joe Biden is not aware of his limitations.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">好的。所以，我……你看起来很棒，杰克。谢谢。我很感激。我，呃，我无法做我41岁时能做的事情了。无论是身体上还是可能精神上。我发现自己在提词器上比五到十年前更容易出错。这很正常。这只是衰老的一部分。我之所以这么说，只是因为我意识到自己的局限性。我不相信乔·拜登没有意识到自己的局限性。</p>

                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">My sense of Joe Biden's belief about himself is not that he has no limits. He knows he walks more slowly and might fall, and they change the way he gets off the plane. That kind of thing, but that he is not sitting there thinking, "I am addled. I am losing it. I have to limit my meetings." No, someone is doing... if you are saying someone is doing that, who is doing that? Does, because you just said a minute ago, right, Mike Donilon, Ricchetti, from everything they say in public, they seem to believe he could have been president through the end of this term, so which is crazy fair enough. But I, I believe on some level they believe it. I believe that they believe it too. So when you say somebody is deciding to limit his meetings with other people, who is deciding to limit his meetings with others? And are they saying this to the rest of the staff? Does a memo go out? Like, what is what is going on here?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我对乔·拜登对自己的看法是，他并非没有极限。他知道他走路会慢一些，可能会摔倒，他们也改变了他下飞机的方式。诸如此类的事情，但他并没有坐在那里想：“我思维混乱了。我失去理智了。我必须限制我的会议。”不，有人在做……如果你说有人在做那件事，那是谁在做？因为你刚才说过，对吧，迈克·多尼伦、里凯蒂，从他们在公开场合所说的一切来看，他们似乎相信他可以一直担任总统到本届任期结束，这已经足够疯狂了。但我，我在某种程度上相信他们是相信的。我相信他们也相信。所以当你说有人决定限制他与其他人的会议时，是谁在决定限制他与其他人的会议？他们会把这个告诉其他员工吗？会发出备忘录吗？比如，这里到底发生了什么？</p>

                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">So, as JFK quoted after the Bay of Pigs, "Success has 100 fathers and defeat is an orphan." There are very few people willing to acknowledge who made the fateful decisions X, Y, or Z. I would say that ultimately on the staffing level, who do I think is responsible for decisions that protected Joe Biden the way that we're talking about? I would say Anthony Bernal, who was the chief of staff for the first lady's office, and perhaps the most powerful chief of staff in the history of first ladies, and Mike Donilon. And those two would convey the wishes of the president and the first lady. So when the decision was made by Joe Biden that he was going to run for reelection, that decision would be conveyed to the staff from Anthony Bernal and Mike Donilon. Mike Donilon would say, "Presidents get to decide if they're running for reelection, and he's decided he's running for reelection. End of story." Anthony Bernal would say, "You don't run for president for one term. You run for president for two terms." And they were conveying the wishes of the first couple. And in the book, we talk about this. There is a shocking lack of discussion about this with Biden. It is just Biden decides he's running, and that's it. And in fact, there's a very good, and I'm sure you know him already, John Anzalone, the pollster, who, you know, he worked for Biden all the way back in like in the 80s when Biden was, you know, plagiarizing speeches in Iowa. John Anzalone has known and loved Joe Biden forever. And Anzalone wants to poll for it. You know, he wants to see what are the liabilities, how do we do this? Obviously, he's aging. And Anita Dunn says, "You know, we're not polling for this. The decision's already been made." And there is not one meeting where they all sit down and talk about this and kick the tires of it. And when Jeff Zients, who becomes the White House Chief of Staff after Ron Klain leaves in early 2023, he comes in, you know, and he's a former Bain Capital guy, he's a he has Bain brain, he wants to like he wants to run the diagnostics, he wants to kick the tires, he wants to see is this a good idea? And but the decision's already been, "Hey, it's done."</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">所以，就像肯尼迪在猪湾事件后引用的话：“成功有一百个父亲，失败是个孤儿。”很少有人愿意承认是谁做出了X、Y或Z的决定。我会说，最终在幕僚层面，我认为谁对我们所说的保护乔·拜登的决定负责？我会说是安东尼·伯纳尔，他是第一夫人办公室主任，也许是第一夫人历史上最有权势的幕僚长，还有迈克·多尼伦。这两个人会传达总统和第一夫人的意愿。所以当乔·拜登做出他将竞选连任的决定时，这个决定会由安东尼·伯纳尔和迈克·多尼伦传达给工作人员。迈克·多尼伦会说：“总统们可以决定他们是否竞选连任，他已经决定竞选连任了。就这样。”安东尼·伯纳尔会说：“你不是只当一届总统。你要当两届总统。”他们传达的是第一家庭的意愿。在书里，我们谈到了这一点。关于这件事，与拜登的讨论惊人地缺乏。就是拜登决定他要参选，然后就没了。事实上，有一个非常棒的，我确信你已经认识他了，民意调查专家约翰·安扎洛内，你知道，他早在80年代就为拜登工作了，当时拜登在爱荷华州抄袭演讲。约翰·安扎洛内一直认识并喜爱乔·拜登。安扎洛内想为此进行民意调查。你知道，他想看看有什么弱点，我们怎么做？显然他正在变老。而安妮塔·邓恩说：“你知道，我们不会为此进行民意调查。决定已经做出了。”没有一次会议，他们都坐下来讨论这件事，仔细审查一下。当杰夫·齐恩茨，他在2023年初罗恩·克莱恩离开后成为白宫幕僚长，他进来了，你知道，他曾是贝恩资本的人，他有贝恩的思维，他想，他想进行诊断，他想仔细审查，他想看看这是不是个好主意？但是决定已经做出，“嘿，搞定了。”</p>

                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">I think that his presence in the Oval declined, and he would spend more time in the residence. Now, in terms of the decision-making itself, what we call them in the book, the Palipiro, that well, we didn't call them that. People in the Biden administration called them that, the Ricchetti, Donilon, etc., the people that surrounded Biden that were like the true believers. They would argue, the Palipiro, that the decisions were always fine and sound and never problematic. There are people in this book, senators, Democratic senators, who would take issue with that. Not as an affirmative prosecution against him, but just as a question. There's a scene in the book where Biden talks to the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, a man with whom he does not have a particularly close relationship. And Warner is concerned because the White House is about to authorize the release of I think it's 11 Yemenis from Gitmo. And there are a lot of senators, Democrats and Republicans, who are worried these guys are just going to go rejoin the fight, whether with the Houthis or Hamas or Hezbollah or whatever. They're going to rejoin the fight. And Biden calls Warner, and Warner is under the impression that Biden does not know much about this, that he doesn't really understand what's going on, and that concerns him. And then there's another scene in June 2024 before the debate. Biden has an immigration event, and Senator Bennett of Colorado goes to it, another pro-Biden Democrat. And Biden has just like this this moment where he's like whispering into the microphone. Nobody can hear a word he's saying.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我认为他在椭圆形办公室的出现频率下降了，他会在官邸里待更多时间。现在，就决策本身而言，我们在书中称之为“内圈”（Palipiro），嗯，我们没有这样称呼他们。是拜登政府内部的人这样称呼他们，里凯蒂、多尼伦等等，那些围绕在拜登身边，就像是真正的信徒的人。他们，“内圈”的人会争辩说，这些决定总是很好很明智，从没有问题。这本书里有些人，参议员，民主党参议员，会对此提出异议。不是作为对他积极的起诉，而只是作为一个疑问。书中有这样一个场景，拜登与参议院情报委员会的民主党领袖马克·华纳交谈，华纳与他的关系并不特别亲密。华纳担心，因为白宫即将授权释放我认为是11名来自关塔那摩的也门人。而很多参议员，无论是民主党还是共和党，都担心这些人会回去重新加入战斗，无论是与胡塞武装、哈马斯还是真主党或其他什么。他们会重新加入战斗。然后拜登打电话给华纳，华纳的印象是拜登对此了解不多，他并不真正理解发生了什么，这让他很担心。然后还有另一个场景，在2024年6月的辩论之前。拜登有一个移民活动，科罗拉多州的参议员班尼特也去了，他也是一个亲拜登的民主党人。然后拜登就在那一刻，他好像在对着麦克风耳语。没有人能听清他在说什么。</p>

                <p class="english-text">It's very odd. And it's reported as Biden forgets the name of his DHS secretary, but it's much worse than that. But in any case, Bennett leaves the White House thinking, "Well, this is why Biden's immigration policy is such a mess. He's not capable of leading the disparate factions in the Democratic party and in his administration on this." And in fact, there had been, I mean, there had been a desire to beef up border security at the beginning of the Biden administration, and that kind of just like faded away, and Secretary Mayorkas and others never knew why. It just went away, and Bennett's overall conclusion is this did have an impact on the country.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">这非常奇怪。报道说拜登忘记了他的国土安全部部长的名字，但情况比那糟糕得多。但无论如何，班尼特离开白宫时心想：“嗯，这就是为什么拜登的移民政策如此混乱的原因。他无法领导民主党内以及他政府内部在这方面的不同派系。”事实上，我的意思是，拜登政府初期曾有加强边境安全的愿望，但这就像是逐渐消失了，马约卡斯部长和其他人从来不知道原因。它就这样消失了，而班尼特的总体结论是，这确实对国家产生了影响。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">I want to pick up on the Bennett vignette because I took note of that too in the book. This binary, I guess, that they created between can you make good decisions and can you do the superficial theatrical dimension of the presidency. One is real presidenting and the other is just BS the media cares about. So I always thought that distinction was incredibly false. The power of the president, as is famously said, is the power to persuade. If you can't communicate effectively, you can't persuade. You are giving up a lot of your power. But a lot of the presidency isn't about major decisions. I mean, you know all this better than I do, but it's just constant presiding over meetings, constant taking in information, constant sensing into the shape, the zeitgeist of the country, of your party, of the issues, of the constituencies. One of my sort of conclusions covering the White House was that Biden's just attentional bandwidth was more limited than it would have been when he was 65, of course. And so he was extremely engaged on Ukraine, extremely engaged on Israel and Gaza. But his attention to domestic policy seemed to me to flag 100%. And his ability or interest. I mean, Biden had sharp elbows for his entire career. He was a moderate Democrat who had little patience for a lot of the people who would disagree with him. And that intense party leadership, "We're going to do this, not that. You guys have gotten too far away from the American people here. We're pivoting back." That was just gone. That doesn't mean he was making bad decisions. But energy matters, right? How present the president is on different topics matters because without him, the White House is not going to do risky things that might cause problems for him.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我想接着班尼特的小插曲谈谈，因为我在书中也注意到了这一点。他们创造的这种二元对立，我想，就是在“你能做出好的决定”和“你能否做到总统表面上的戏剧性表演”之间。一个才是真正的总统之职，另一个只是媒体关心的废话。所以我一直认为这种区分是极其错误的。总统的权力，正如那句名言所说，是说服的权力。如果你不能有效地沟通，你就无法说服。你正在放弃你很多权力。但总统的很多工作并非都是重大决策。我的意思是，你比我更了解这一切，但这只是不断地主持会议，不断地接收信息，不断地感受国家、你的政党、议题、选民的形态和时代精神。我报道白宫的一个结论是，拜登的注意力带宽比他65岁时更有限，这当然是事实。所以他极度关注乌克兰，极度关注以色列和加沙。但在我看来，他对国内政策的关注度百分之百地下降了。以及他的能力或兴趣。我的意思是，拜登在他的整个职业生涯中都是一个强硬派。他是一个温和的民主党人，对许多与他意见相左的人几乎没有耐心。而那种强烈的党派领导力，“我们要这样做，不要那样做。你们在这里已经离美国人民太远了。我们要转向回来。”那一切都消失了。这并不意味着他做出了错误的决定。但精力很重要，对吧？总统在不同议题上的投入程度很重要，因为没有他，白宫就不会去做可能给他带来麻烦的冒险事情。</p>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. I think that when it came to domestic policy, he let his first chief of staff, Ron Klain, kind of run things for a while. Ron Klain, who was a hero to progressives, and therefore Joe Biden in many ways was a hero to progressives. And that's one of the reasons, by the way, that the progressives were the very last ones to abandon him, the progressives and the Black Caucus. Because they had gotten so much that they wanted from him policy-wise. I don't mean in a pejorative way, policy is why they're in the game. So I think you're right. I think it became something that he was not focused on. And then beyond that, I think also is just the fact that, as you note, he was interested in foreign policy. That's his area of expertise. And in fact, but one of the reasons Obama picks him is for that. And that really is just what he likes.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的，我认为这绝对正确。我认为在内政方面，他让他的第一任幕僚长罗恩·克莱恩在一段时间内主导事务。罗恩·克莱恩是进步派的英雄，因此乔·拜登在很多方面也是进步派的英雄。顺便说一句，这也是为什么进步派是最后一个放弃他的人，进步派和黑人党团。因为他们在政策上从他那里得到了他们想要的东西。我不是贬义地说，政策是他们参与的原因。所以我认为你说得对。我认为这成了他不再关注的事情。除此之外，我认为事实也是，正如你所指出的，他对外交政策很感兴趣。那是他的专业领域。事实上，奥巴马选择他的一部分原因也正是为此。那真的只是他喜欢做的事情。</p>

That's a cabinet secretary telling us that. That's not, you know, Donald Trump Jr., it's not Steve Bannon. It's a Biden-loving Democratic cabinet secretary.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">但我们有一位内阁秘书说，这在书里也有记载，如果你期望总统是一个能在凌晨两点被国家或国际危机唤醒的人，那么拜登在2024年是做不到的。那是内阁秘书告诉我们的。那不是，你知道，小唐纳德·特朗普，也不是史蒂夫·班农。那是一个爱拜登的民主党内阁秘书。</p>

But you know, we interviewed more than 200 people, and that was almost all after the election. But yeah, I mean, they, we have cabinet secretaries in there talking about something happened. They kept them at bay, and one of them saying that they didn't think that he could be relied upon to handle that 2 AM phone call, which is actually a very terrifying thought.</p>

                <p class="english-text">It seems to me that in the campaign, the most consequential decision made after Joe Biden decides to run for reelection, which is huge, which is a huge decision, but yes, although as you say, doesn't even seem to have been a decision at all in the sense that there was a process, a conversation, there was no process. But it was a decision by the president, is the decision to go for a June debate. Now if you're not a presidential campaign nerd, that doesn't happen. Usually we do not have June debates.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">在我看来，在竞选中，乔·拜登决定竞选连任之后做出的最具影响力的决定，这是一个巨大的决定，是的，虽然如你所说，这甚至根本不像一个决定，因为它没有一个过程，没有一次对话，根本没有过程。但这是一个总统的决定，那就是决定进行一场六月辩论。如果你不是一个总统竞选狂热者，那通常不会发生。我们通常不会在六月举行辩论。</p>

                <p class="english-text">It's a complicated process, and there are lots of different parts. One of the parts is that both Trump and Biden had lost all confidence in the Commission on Presidential Debates. So they had just, they had discarded it. And so it was really for the networks, every network for himself or herself trying to get a debate. There was an eagerness by both Trump and Biden to start the presidential campaign. For Joe Biden's case, he and Donilon thought, the sooner we make this a choice election, the better. Right now it's a referendum on Biden, and as Biden would always say, "Don't compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative." Biden thought the moment people realize that it's between me and Donald Trump, they will come back to me. Now there were people internally who thought, "No, we shouldn't do this." Steve Ricchetti thought that debating Trump just like sullied everybody involved in the process. He brings out the worst in everybody. The old saw about don't ever wrestle with a pig because you just get dirty and the pig likes it. And Anita Dunn initially, and General Jen O'Malley Dillon didn't want Biden to debate Trump for any number of reasons. But then the Hur report dropped, in which there were serious questions and a permission structure for folks in the media to talk about the aging issue. And then Anita Dunn thought, "Okay, we do have to do this. We have to, we have to show that he's okay and he can do this." And that's where the June debate came in. An eagerness by Biden to change the subject from himself to Donald Trump.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">这是一个复杂的过程，涉及许多不同的部分。其中一部分是，特朗普和拜登都对总统辩论委员会失去了信心。所以他们只是，他们抛弃了它。因此，实际上是各家电视网，每个电视网都在努力争取到一场辩论。特朗普和拜登都渴望开始总统竞选。就乔·拜登而言，他与多尼伦认为，我们越早将这次选举变成一次选择性选举越好。现在这是一场针对拜登的公投，正如拜登常说的：“不要把我与上帝相比，把我与替代者相比。”拜登认为，一旦人们意识到是在他与唐纳德·特朗普之间做选择，他们就会回到他身边。现在内部有人认为：“不，我们不应该这样做。”史蒂夫·里凯蒂认为，与特朗普辩论只会玷污所有参与其中的人。他会激发出每个人的最坏一面。就像那句老话说的，永远不要和猪摔跤，因为你只会弄脏自己，而猪喜欢这样。安妮塔·邓恩最初，以及詹·奥马利·狄龙将军，都出于各种原因不希望拜登与特朗普辩论。但随后赫尔报告发布了，其中包含严肃的问题，并为媒体界讨论年龄问题提供了一个许可结构。然后安妮塔·邓恩认为：“好吧，我们必须这样做。我们必须，我们必须表明他没事，他能做到。”于是六月辩论就来了。这是拜登渴望将话题从自己身上转移到唐纳德·特朗普身上。</p>

                <p class="english-text">I would say it was malpractice by his people and the degree to which they were not honest with themselves about Joe Biden's abilities, uh, and such is kind of striking. The evidence for the fact that it was a cover-up is the fact that we were all so shocked by what we saw on the debate stage on June 27th, when in reality that was not a shock to people who had seen him like that behind the scenes.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我会说，这是他身边的人的失职，以及他们对自己乔·拜登的能力的不诚实程度，呃，这相当惊人。证明这是掩盖行为的证据就是，我们都被6月27日辩论台上所看到的一切震惊了，而实际上，对那些幕后见过他那样的人来说，这根本不令人震惊。</p>

                <p class="english-text">Oh, really? That's funny. I, I guess because I had done this thing after I had done these pieces and before I did these pieces where I went back through all of these speeches and looked at all these clips and came to the view he really wasn't looking good quite often. But what's it like for you being there? You're co-moderating that debate. It begins. He... Well, first before it begins, he is late showing up. We were in Atlanta, in a battleground state, Georgia, that Biden won in 2020 and Trump won in 2016. And the both both campaigns and candidates had been offered walkthroughs. Donald Trump shows up. Neither of them show up on time, of course, but the time for them to show up was, you know, laughably early. It wasn't really necessary for them to show up as early as CNN asked them to be. But Donald Trump shows up and, you know, whatever you think of Donald Trump, he's he's a pro. "Which one's my camera? What if I want to ask a follow-up? What if I want this? You know, what do I do when he's talking? When, when, when Biden's talking, is the camera on me, etc., etc." Now, I'm supposed to go out. The debate starting at 9 PM, which by the way was another shocker to me. When I found out that they had agreed to do a 9 PM debate for an hour and a half, I thought to myself, "That seems late. That's late for me." Like how is it going to be for Joe Biden? I mean, I understand Donald Trump runs on some energy force that I don't understand, but like, uh, that's late, but okay. I guess they know what they're doing. I think there is a degree to which of, "I guess they know what they're doing," infected the heads of so many of us covering him because why would you put him out there for an hour and a half debate at 9:00 at night when you they could have agreed to a 7 PM debate.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">哦，真的吗？这很有趣。我想是因为我写完这些文章之后和之前，我做了一件事，就是回顾了所有这些演讲，看了所有这些片段，然后得出了一个结论：他很多时候看起来确实不太好。但你在那里感觉如何？你正在联合主持那场辩论。它开始了。他……好吧，首先在开始之前，他迟到了。我们在亚特兰大，一个摇摆州，佐治亚州，拜登在2020年赢了，特朗普在2016年赢了。竞选团队和候选人双方都得到了彩排的机会。唐纳德·特朗普出现了。当然他们俩都没有准时出现，但他们应该出现的时间，你知道，早得可笑。他们没必要像CNN要求的那样早出现。但唐纳德·特朗普出现了，你知道，无论你怎么看唐纳德·特朗普，他都是个专业人士。“哪个是我的摄像机？如果我想追问怎么办？如果我想要这个怎么办？你知道，他说话时我该怎么办？当，当，当拜登说话时，摄像机在我身上吗，等等。”现在，我应该出去了。辩论在晚上9点开始，顺便说一句，这对我来说又是一个震惊。当我发现他们同意在晚上9点进行一个半小时的辩论时，我心想：“这似乎很晚。对我来说都很晚。”对乔·拜登来说会怎么样呢？我的意思是，我理解唐纳德·特朗普靠着我无法理解的某种能量运作，但，呃，那很晚了，但好吧。我想他们知道自己在做什么。我认为在某种程度上，“我想他们知道自己在做什么”感染了我们许多报道他的人，因为为什么你会在晚上9点让他出去进行一个半小时的辩论，而他们本可以同意一场晚上7点的辩论。</p>

                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Oh, wait. He had also, I think it's an important thing in their heads as I understand it. They sort of see him as a clutch player. He gives this pretty excellent, at least for him at this period, State of the Union address in 2024, and he's vibrant and he's loud and his quiet voice is gone and there's all this talk about, "Do they have him on stimulants?" Right? But I think they had come to the view that Biden can perform in the clutch. He's a gamer. That's what they say. He's a gamer.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">哦，等等。他还有，我认为在他们脑海中，据我理解，这是一件重要的事情。他们把他看作是一个关键时刻能发挥作用的选手。他在2024年发表了这场对当时的他来说相当出色的国情咨文，他充满活力，声音洪亮，他那沙哑的声音不见了，到处都在讨论：“他们给他吃了兴奋剂吗？”对吧？但我认为他们已经形成了这样一种观点，即拜登能在关键时刻表现。他是个“游戏玩家”。他们就是这么说的。他是个“游戏玩家”。</p>

                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">To look at the legend of Joe Biden and everything he has overcome and not realize that that infuses the man with a degree of not just the man, but the man and his family and his supporters with a sense of, "This guy rises to the occasion," and it doesn't matter what fate throws at him, and fate has thrown a lot of horrible things at him, he will rise. And his whole philosophy, as he lays out in one of his books, is "Get up," his dad used to say to him, "Get up." So, yes, this idea that he's a gamer, this idea that he will rise, that yes, this has been a horrible month for him. He's traveled all over the place, and his son was convicted in a court, but he is and he showed up to debate rehearsal, debate practice unprepared and sick and needing to take naps, but he is going to rise to this moment. Okay. Yeah, I get it. That's how that's how they think about these things. And that's how Joe Biden thinks about these things because at 8:30 I'm supposed to be out on stage just sitting there, and they're doing lighting and all that stuff. And I can't go out there because Joe Biden has just shown up a half hour before the debate. He's supposed to have been there hours before. And why was he so late? Because he didn't think he needed to do it. He didn't think he needed to do a walkthrough, which is crazy. Every candidate does a walkthrough. Barack Obama did walkthroughs like you just do this. So he walks out, he hobbles out, you know, he does that shifting thing, shuffling thing, seeming really old, but I had seen him, so I was not surprised. He starts talking. He obviously has a cold. He sounds awful. His voice is already thinner and hoarser than it had been, but now it's, you know, it's really bad. His first answer is whatever. It's fine, serviceable. But then he gets to that horrible answer where he completely loses his train of thought. Eligible for what I've been able to do with the uh, with with with the COVID, excuse me, with um dealing with everything we have to do with uh, look, if we finally beat Medicare. Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, he's right. He did beat Medicare. He beat it to death. And we have these iPads and I wrote to the control room, "Holy smokes." And Dana [Bash] writes to me on a piece of paper, "He just lost the election."</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">看看乔·拜登的传奇，以及他克服的一切，不难发现，这不仅赋予了他本人，也赋予了他和他的家人以及支持者一种信念：“这个人总能应对挑战”，无论命运向他抛出什么，而命运确实向他抛出了许多可怕的事情，他都会奋起。正如他在自己的一本书中阐述的，他的整个哲学就是“站起来”，他的父亲过去常对他说：“站起来。”所以，是的，他是个“游戏玩家”的想法，他会振作起来的想法，是的，这个月对他来说是可怕的一个月。他到处奔波，他的儿子在法庭上被判有罪，但他来了，他出现在辩论彩排中，辩论练习时他没有准备，生病了，需要小睡，但他将挺身而出应对这一刻。好的。是的，我明白了。他们就是这样看待这些事情的。乔·拜登也是这样看待这些事情的，因为8点半的时候我本应该坐在舞台上，他们正在进行灯光调试等等。我不能出去，因为乔·拜登刚刚在辩论前半小时才出现。他本应该几个小时前就在那里的。他为什么迟到？因为他认为他不需要这么做。他认为他不需要进行彩排，这太疯狂了。每个候选人都会进行彩排。巴拉克·奥巴马也会进行彩排，就像你这样做一样。所以他走出去，他蹒跚地走出去，你知道，他那样摇晃着，拖着步子，显得真的很老，但我见过他，所以我不惊讶。他开始说话。他显然感冒了。他听起来很糟糕。他的声音比以前更细更沙哑了，但现在，你知道，真的更糟糕了。他的第一个回答随便说说。还行，能用。但随后他给出了那个可怕的回答，他完全失去了思路。有资格做我能做的与，呃，与新冠，对不起，与，嗯，处理我们必须做的所有事情，呃，看，如果我们最终击败医疗保险。谢谢你，拜登总统。特朗普总统，他说得对。他确实击败了医疗保险。他把它彻底击垮了。我们有这些iPad，我写信给控制室：“天哪。”戴娜（巴什）在一张纸上写给我：“他刚刚输掉了选举。”</p>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">It's one thing about this debate, and it was why his just complete absence of doing any serious extended oppositional interviews, just tough interviews. I don't mean like with Fox News, I mean, you know, say with you, was, I think, worrying. You can talk about communication style. You can talk about how somebody comes off when they're communicating, but one thing communication is supposed to reveal is train of thought. Is how people are reasoning under pressure. And what I watched in that debate was somebody who under pressure was not reasoning well. You, you would not want this person in the meeting with Xi. You would not want this person exhausted after a couple nights of poor sleep in an international crisis. You wouldn't really want this person being the the, the principal structuring and deciding between competing alternatives in a hot meeting about immigration or inflation. That I, I feel like this is where saying it's all communication, as they often did, really fell apart. Like communication is like how you think, right?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">这场辩论有一点，这也是为什么他完全没有进行任何严肃的、长时间的对立性采访，只是艰难的采访。我指的不是像福克斯新闻那样的，我是说，比如和你，这让我觉得担忧。你可以谈论沟通风格。你可以谈论一个人在沟通时的表现，但沟通应该揭示的一点是思路。是人们在压力下如何进行推理。而我在那场辩论中看到的是一个人在压力下推理能力不佳。你，你不会希望这个人与习会面。你不会希望这个人在一个国际危机中，经历几个晚上糟糕的睡眠后筋疲力尽。你不会真的希望这个人在一个关于移民或通货膨胀的热门会议中，作为主要负责人来构建和决定相互竞争的替代方案。我，我觉得这就是他们经常说的“这都是沟通”的说法彻底瓦解的地方。就像沟通就是你的思维方式，对吧？</p>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Yeah. And he was not staying on normal tracks, like his, his own train of thought was derailing. There were people that we talked to who worked for Joe Biden, okay? I'm not talking about Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham and I mean, who worked for Joe Biden, who watched that debate and thought, "Who is running the country because it's not that person?" Now I, that's not me saying that. That's them saying that. But I think it is a reasonable question.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。他没有按照正常的思路走，他的思路正在脱轨。我们采访了一些为乔·拜登工作的人，好吗？我说的不是肖恩·汉尼提和劳拉·英格拉姆，我的意思是，那些为乔·拜登工作的人，他们看了那场辩论，然后想：“现在是谁在管理这个国家？因为不是那个人。”现在我，我不是在说这个。是他们这么说的。但我认为这是一个合理的问题。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">So I found that debate incredibly disturbing, and the degree to which the Democratic Party attempted to gaslight the country. And when I say Democratic Party, I mean mainly the White House, but also leaders of the Democratic Party attempted to gaslight the public about it immediately as if like, "Oh, he had a cold." I've had colds. We've all had colds. This was not that. And I think one of the reasons why the Democratic Party's numbers are still so low is that they have not reckoned with the lies that they told about this. And these are lies. These are not lies about tariffs. These are not lies about economic policy or things that I don't fully understand as the average voter. These are lies about things that we all perfectly understand: aging, colds, being addled, not being at your best. I mean, these are things that we all have access to.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">所以我觉得那场辩论令人极其不安，以及民主党试图对国家进行“煤气灯操纵”的程度。当我说民主党时，我主要指白宫，但也包括民主党的领导人，他们试图立即就此事对公众进行“煤气灯操纵”，仿佛在说：“哦，他只是感冒了。”我感冒过。我们都感冒过。这不是那种情况。我认为民主党支持率仍然如此低迷的原因之一是，他们没有正视他们就此事撒下的谎言。而这些都是谎言。这些不是关于关税的谎言。这些不是关于经济政策或我作为普通选民不完全理解的事情的谎言。这些是关于我们都完全理解的事情的谎言：衰老、感冒、思维混乱、不在最佳状态。我的意思是，这些都是我们都能接触到的事实。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">So, I talked to a lot of members of Congress in that period between the debate and Biden stepping aside. And I'd watch them go through this thing where they would talk me through every meeting basically they had had with him in the past, you know, year or two. And those meetings they began to realize had become more seldom than they had been before. But there'd be the meeting where he was great. 2021, 2022. Or even there were meetings like that in 2023 and even 2024. People still had good experiences with him in those years. And there would sometimes be the memory of something they had sort of pushed aside where they thought he was tired or they thought he was distracted. You, I often heard people say, they often thought he was distracted by some other matter, which when it's the president is not a crazy thing to imagine that their mind is on, you know, some terrible crisis. And that you know, we all have a bunch of data points in our head about other people, and we have an image of them and then we have also the image of them, it is convenient for us to believe, and it can take a lot to push us off of that. But then when you get pushed, you sort of reconstruct a new story out of things you had been downplaying.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">所以，在辩论和拜登辞职之间的那段时间里，我采访了很多国会议员。我看到他们经历这样一个过程，他们会给我讲述过去一两年里他们与拜登的每一次会议。他们开始意识到这些会议变得比以前更少见了。但总会有他表现很好的会议。2021年，2022年。甚至2023年乃至2024年也有那样的会议。那些年人们与他仍然有很好的经历。有时他们会想起一些他们曾压下不去想的事情，比如他们觉得他很累，或者觉得他心不在焉。你，我经常听到人们说，他们经常觉得他被其他事情分心了，当那个人是总统时，想象他们的心思在某个可怕的危机上，这并非疯狂的想法。而且你知道，我们头脑中有很多关于其他人的数据点，我们对他们有一个形象，然后我们也有一个我们认为方便自己相信的形象，要让我们改变这种看法可能需要很多努力。但当你受到冲击时，你就会从那些你曾轻描淡写的事情中重新构建一个新故事。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">A lot. And I think that especially these are political animals and they were terrified of Donald Trump. And I think that after it became clear that Donald Trump was going to be the nominee, a lot of people said, "Well, this is what we got, and this is the only one, this is the only person who's ever beaten Donald Trump, so this is what we got to do." And a lot of members of Congress who saw things and wanted to speak up were told, "What do you want, Donald Trump? This is what you want?" They were called a traitor.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">很多。我认为尤其是这些人都是政治动物，他们对唐纳德·特朗普感到恐惧。我认为在唐纳德·特朗普将成为提名人选变得明确之后，很多人都说：“好吧，这就是我们所拥有的，而且这是唯一一个，这是唯一一个曾经击败过唐纳德·特朗普的人，所以我们必须这样做。”很多看到问题并想发声的国会议员被告知：“你想要什么？唐纳德·特朗普吗？这就是你想要的吗？”他们被称为叛徒。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">I want you to be more specific because that isn't what they were told in a way. They were told, at least in my experience, they were told, "Do you want Kamala Harris?"</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我想让你更具体一点，因为在某种程度上他们被告知的不是那个。至少根据我的经验，他们被告知的是：“你想要卡玛拉·哈里斯吗？”</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Oh, well, that was another, that was another argument. And that's that was the actual, it seemed to me, first line of defense. Sure. Absolutely. The Kamala defense, which is, "If Joe Biden doesn't do it, do you want his Vice President who is even less popular than him to be the nominee? That's crazy." So yes, she was their line of defense. And by the way, this drove David Plouffe insane. David Plouffe, of course, he was Barack Obama's incredibly successful 2008 campaign manager, served as a senior adviser to Obama and then basically retired from politics in 2012 until he was called back to help Kamala Harris run for president in July 2024. This drove this drove Plouffe crazy because Plouffe's whole argument was, "You picked her. You picked her to be the Vice President. If you didn't have confidence in her, you shouldn't have picked her." And he knows what he's talking about because he and Axelrod helped pick Biden for Obama.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">哦，嗯，那是另一个，那是另一个论点。那才是实际上，在我看来，第一道防线。当然。绝对是。卡玛拉防线，那就是，“如果乔·拜登不干了，你希望他的副总统，一个比他还不受欢迎的人来担任提名人吗？那太疯狂了。”所以，是的，她是他们的防线。顺便说一句，这让戴维·普劳夫快疯了。戴维·普劳夫，当然，他是巴拉克·奥巴马2008年极其成功的竞选经理，曾担任奥巴马的高级顾问，然后基本上于2012年从政界退休，直到2024年7月被召回帮助卡玛拉·哈里斯竞选总统。这让普劳夫快疯了，因为普劳夫的全部论点是：“是你们选择了她。你们选择她当副总统。如果你对她没有信心，你就不应该选择她。”他知道自己在说什么，因为他和阿克塞尔罗德帮助奥巴马选择了拜登。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Well, this was a thing that drove me completely crazy in that post-debate period. The Biden team's response, Joe Biden's response when he called in to say, "Morning Joe," was, "The elites are trying to push me out of the race. I'm getting so frustrated, but by the elites, now I'm not talking about you guys, but by the elites in the party who they know so much more. But any of these guys don't think I should run against me. Go ahead, announce announce the president. Challenge me at the convention." But the elites, myself very much included, you know, with my stuff in in February of that year, were late. If you looked at polling, going back years at that point, supermajorities of the country believed he was too old to run again. This had been true in 2022. It was something that Biden himself had to finesse in the 2020 race when he didn't quite promise to be a one-term president, but he said things that sounded like that, that he was going to be a transitional figure. But the public had already come to this conclusion long ago. And you could see it. It was in every poll forever. It was the Democratic Party that was late to give it credence. Put aside whether or not you thought the issue was that he could or could not perform the role of the presidency. The public is saying, "We don't want this guy." We don't think he should continue being president. And then the party, you know, in the ways that parties do, closes ranks around him, nobody of any national profile will dare run against him in the 2023. Even though people are trying to, they're trying to get like Bill Daley and others, Bill Daley, Obama's former chief of staff and others are trying to get Pritzker, Whitmer, whoever. Dean Phillips is is, you know, attacked. There's efforts to not allow him on the ballot in certain states. Wisconsin. Yeah, in Wisconsin. But I think there's a reason that you don't get a a big primary that year. I, I actually had been planning to write right after the midterm election, Democrats need a primary. Just even just to see if Biden is capable of running again. You, you just can't give this to him without testing his capability to campaign. But Democrats were so thrilled with how they gained some ground in the Senate in 2022. They held down losses in the House. And even though Biden hadn't been in any super significant way out there on the campaign trail, even though his approval rating was a main thing the Democrats had to get over, the sense was, "Oh, Biden did it again. He was underestimated by the media again. He was underestimated by the politicos again." And here he is and he led his Democratic Party to a much better midterm result than Barack Obama did in 2010, then Bill Clinton did in 1994. That's what all the, that's what Donilon would tell everybody. And you just felt like all the energy out of the possibility of anybody primarying him who is a sort of serious national figure in the party, drain, right? It was just gone.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，这件事在辩论后的那段时间里让我彻底抓狂。拜登团队的回应，乔·拜登在电话连线“早安乔”时说的是：“精英们正试图把我赶出竞选。我感到非常沮丧，但那些精英，我现在不是指你们，而是党内的精英，他们知道更多。但这些人中的任何一个都不认为我应该参选对抗我。去吧，宣布总统。在党代会上挑战我。”但精英们，包括我在内，你知道，我在那年二月写的东西，都太晚了。如果你看当时的民意调查，追溯到几年前，绝大多数美国人认为他太老了，不应该再竞选。这在2022年就已经如此。这是拜登在2020年竞选中必须巧妙处理的事情，当时他没有明确承诺只当一届总统，但他说了些听起来像那样的话，说他将是一个过渡人物。但公众早就得出这个结论了。你可以看到它。它永远都在每一次民意调查中。是民主党迟迟没有给予它信任。姑且不论你是否认为问题在于他能否履行总统职责。公众说的是：“我们不想要这个人。”我们不认为他应该继续担任总统。然后这个党派，你知道，就像党派惯常那样，团结在他周围，没有任何全国知名度的人物敢于在2023年与他竞争。尽管有人试图，他们试图让像比尔·戴利和其他人，比尔·戴利，奥巴马的前幕僚长和其他人，试图让普利茨克、惠特默，随便谁。迪安·菲利普斯受到了攻击。有人试图阻止他在某些州进入选票。威斯康星州。是的，在威斯康星州。但我认为那一年没有一场大型初选是有原因的。我，我实际上在中期选举后就计划写，民主党需要一场初选。甚至只是为了看看拜登是否还能再次竞选。你，你不能不测试他的竞选能力就直接把这个机会给他。但民主党人对他们在2022年参议院取得的进展感到非常高兴。他们控制住了众议院的损失。尽管拜登在竞选活动中并没有以任何非常重要的方式露面，尽管他的支持率是民主党必须克服的一个主要问题，但大家的感觉是：“哦，拜登又做到了。他再次被媒体低估了。他再次被政治家低估了。”而他就在这里，他带领他的民主党在中期选举中取得了比巴拉克·奥巴马2010年、比尔·克林顿1994年更好的结果。那就是所有的，那就是多尼伦会告诉每个人的。你只是觉得党内任何一个重要的全国性人物挑战他的可能性都被耗尽了，对吧？它就是消失了。</p>

                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">I would add on the midterms, there is a lot of evidence that they went the way they went despite Biden, not because of Biden, that the two main things that Democrats had going for them were, a, the Dobbs decision, the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which resulted in a lot of single-issue voters very mobilized by the abortion rights issue. The Republicans had less than stellar Senate candidates, and in some cases House nominees too. And that's really one of the reasons why I think that the midterm went the way it did.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">关于中期选举，我想补充一点，有很多证据表明它们是尽管有拜登才那样发展的，而不是因为拜登，民主党有两个主要有利因素，一是多布斯案的裁决，即推翻“罗诉韦德案”，这导致大量单一议题选民被堕胎权问题极大地动员起来。共和党参议院候选人表现不佳，在某些情况下众议院提名人选也是。这确实是我认为中期选举结果如此的原因之一。</p>

                <p class="english-text">This is one of my sliding doors moments in recent American politics. Imagine the red wave had hit. The Democrats get wiped out in the House. They get wiped out in the Senate. Biden does not look like some uncanny political genius. And also, the party has to take his unpopularity seriously. So, Biden is unpopular by this point. And I'm talking to his people, the same people you're talking about here after the election, and asking them, "Okay, what are you, what are you taking from this? What's your, what's your read of this?" And they are telling me directly that this proves that presidential approval has decoupled from election results. That the fact that Biden is low 40s, high 30s, that in this era of highly negative polarization with a Democratic Party that's highly committed to beating Donald Trump, to restoring abortion rights, that the fact that Biden is unpopular, "Well, we just saw the midterms. Unpopularity doesn't tell you that much about how the election is going to turn out." And so there also isn't then a need to address his unpopularity, to do a kind of big center pivot in the way that Bill Clinton did after 94, in the way that Barack Obama did after 2010. A thing that annoyed liberals in both cases, but was part of them confronting the fact that voters did not seem to be buying what they were selling. That also feels like it was very, very significant.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">这是我最近美国政治中一个“滑动门”时刻。想象一下红色浪潮来袭。民主党在众议院被彻底击败。他们在参议院也被彻底击败。拜登看起来不像什么不可思议的政治天才。而且，党派必须认真对待他的不受欢迎。所以，此时拜登是不受欢迎的。我在选举后和他的团队，就是你在这里谈到的那些人交谈，问他们：“好吧，你们从中得到了什么？你们怎么解读这个？”他们直接告诉我，这证明了总统支持率已经与选举结果脱钩。就是说，拜登的支持率在40%以下，30%以上，在这个高度负面两极分化的时代，民主党高度致力于击败唐纳德·特朗普，恢复堕胎权，拜登不受欢迎的事实，“嗯，我们刚刚看到了中期选举。不受欢迎并不能说明太多关于选举结果的事情。”所以也就不需要解决他的不受欢迎问题，不需要像比尔·克林顿在94年后那样进行一次大的中间派转向，像巴拉克·奥巴马在2010年后那样。这在两种情况下都让自由派感到恼火，但这是他们面对选民似乎不买账这一事实的一部分。这感觉也非常非常重要。</p>

                <p class="english-text">Um, yeah, I think that that is very wise. I also would say that Mike Donilon, who came up as a pollster, is one of the most interesting things about him and his character that so much of what he does is based on gut and not data. You know, "Battle for the Soul of America," that's gut. There's no, the numbers that support that that was a strong argument or are questionable. The decoupling of the presidency from midterms. I mean, there's no actual data to back up these arguments, but it's what they think. It's how they convince themselves of these arguments. He's the only one that ever beat Trump. Okay, that's true. But that doesn't mean he's there only two general elections Donald Trump is running at this point. Yeah. I mean, and and Hillary, you know, won the popular vote. It's kind of, kind that one was kind of a fluke, and it created this sort of distance that opened up, I think, between Democratic Party leads in the country where their view the Democratic Party was that Biden was historically successful, and under any normal measure, one, he should, he deserves to run for re-election and win it. But two, who are you to question him when he has been so successful? On the other hand, the country didn't feel he was being that successful. He was unpopular. People were unhappy with his administration. They were not feeling the Biden. They did not feel the world was a more stable and orderly place. And I think there's this way in which the Democratic Party just kind of got a little bit into an insular conversation with itself.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，是的，我认为那非常明智。我还要说，迈克·多尼伦，他最初是一名民意调查员，他身上最有趣的一点就是，他所做的大部分事情都是基于直觉而非数据。你知道，“为美国灵魂而战”，那是直觉。没有，支持那是强有力论据的数字是值得怀疑的。总统任期与中期选举的脱钩。我的意思是，没有实际数据来支持这些论点，但这只是他们的想法。他们就是这样说服自己这些论点的。他是唯一一个曾经击败特朗普的人。好吧，这是事实。但这并不意味着他现在只参加了两场大选。是的。我的意思是，希拉里，你知道，赢得了普选票。这有点，那次有点侥幸，它创造了一种距离，我想，在国家层面上的民主党领导人之间产生了距离，他们认为民主党认为拜登是历史性的成功者，并且在任何正常标准下，第一，他应该，他理应竞选连任并获胜。但第二，当他如此成功时，你有什么资格质疑他？另一方面，国家并不认为他如此成功。他不受欢迎。人们对他的政府不满。他们感受不到拜登的好处。他们不觉得世界变得更稳定有序。我认为民主党就是这样，有点陷入了与自己的孤立对话中。</p>

                <p class="english-text">I mean, I think you, you your question answers itself, which is the Democratic Party was talking to itself. I, I would without question argue that the CHIPS Act and the Infrastructure Bill are huge achievements. There's no question. But why did the American people not know that? Was it because you weren't talking about it? No. Was it because I wasn't talking about it? No. I was talking about it. There's nothing that Washington media loves more than bipartisan legislation passing. I mean, that is just like, that is the wet dream of every reporter in Washington D.C. It's bipartisan and it passed. Therefore, it must be good. Um, but in this case, you know, investing in infrastructure in this country is a good thing because our infrastructure is so horrible. So why wasn't, why weren't the American people sold?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我的意思是，我认为你，你的问题本身就回答了，那就是民主党在自说自话。我，我毫无疑问地认为《芯片法案》和《基础设施法案》是巨大的成就。毫无疑问。但为什么美国人民不知道呢？是因为你没有谈论它吗？不是。是因为我没有谈论它吗？不是。我谈论了。华盛顿媒体最喜欢的就是两党合作的立法通过。我的意思是，那简直是每个华盛顿记者的美梦。它是两党合作的，而且通过了。所以，它一定很好。嗯，但在这种情况下，你知道，在这个国家投资基础设施是件好事，因为我们的基础设施太糟糕了。那么为什么，为什么美国人民没有接受呢？</p>

And so then having not been given a choice in the primary, the party then goes and says, "See, the Democratic voters chose Joe Biden, right?" And now you'd be betraying them. Put aside everything else. This is just a party that is not in this period listening in your reporting.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我会说，那是因为他对人们感受到的通货膨胀一无所知，这其中有多少是年龄原因，有多少是他固执己见，以及除此之外他无法沟通。所以，在初选中没有得到选择权的情况下，党派接着就说：“看，民主党选民选择了乔·拜登，对吧？”而现在你就会背叛他们。撇开其他一切不谈。这只是一个在这个时期没有倾听的党派，根据你的报道。</p>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">I would say that there are two reasons. One, the lack of support among senators meant a lot to him. And there is a meeting that the Senate only gets, well, they want one with Biden, but they don't get it. And they only get one with leaders of his campaign in the White House when because they... That was very telling, by the way, when they wouldn't send Biden to that meeting. Basically, it comes down to there are five senators in a, I think it's a 51-member Senate Democratic caucus. There only five who are standing with Biden. And there are a lot of Democrats who are running for reelection, who are on the bubble, who are their jobs are really at risk. And then I think, um, he kept on, he kept on being told the polls say you can't win, but you know, Biden kept saying, "That's not what my guys say," and he's he's talking about, he's not talking about his pollsters, but he's talking about his pollsters' polls as described to him by Donilon and Ricchetti who constantly give this unrealistically optimistic view of the polling. I mean, it would have been a wipeout without question. There there's also one of the things in this period when they're saying, "Look, he's still only three or four points behind Donald Trump. We can make it up." At that point, you had a history of him just not being able to make it up. You know, you, you come out for the Robert Hur press conference, you flood the countries, you fail at the debate. You could have had more things happen. This was to me the, the sort of crazy risk that I was watching a lot of Democrats at least publicly say they were willing to take, that this guy had not been a game time player for a long time with the exception of one scripted State of the Union. The idea that you're going to get through a tough campaign where you had to make up ground and this guy can't even do interviews. The fundamental problem, the pollsters ultimately, they were supposed to have a meeting with Biden and then that got canceled. So they had a meeting with the Palipiro or a Zoom meeting and basically what they say is the fundamental reason why you're behind cannot be changed. The American people have concluded that you are too old and cannot do the job and you are not capable of disproving that to them. And at this point, we've all seen the three, I mean, you don't have to be a political science major or, you know, a highly paid operative to say, "Okay, he had a bad debate. Go out there, do 10 tough interviews and five town halls and settle this issue." I mean, everybody knows that and he couldn't do it. And ultimately, the Democrats who were seeing him, giving him the benefit of the doubt, Chuck Schumer, others come to that conclusion. He can't do it. But then the other thing, the last thing that I think was decisive, um, Minyon Moore was in charge of the 2024 Democratic convention, longtime Democratic operative, very respected in this town. When she got the job, she set up a thing, an unofficial group called the "What If Committee." And the What If Committee was there to talk about, "Well, what if Biden drops out? What if the protests are so bad they, uh, they shut down Chicago?" Just any, any possible thing. One of the reasons why, uh, it wasn't as difficult in three weeks or whatever it was to swap out, three, three and a half weeks, I think it was between Biden dropping out and and the convention. Why it wasn't as difficult to do is because Minyon Moore had decided they were going to have, uh, decorations in as vanilla a flavor as possible, so that if somebody else's name needed to be in there, you know, it wasn't like, it wasn't like everything was in the shape of Delaware. Let's put it that way. The What If Committee was in touch with all the delegates and they were monitoring everything and eventually before the weekend where Ricchetti and Biden and Donilon talk and and that Sunday, the 21st of July when Biden announces he's not running anymore. The What If Committee conveys to the Palipiro, "You can win at the convention, but it will be really ugly." They were losing delegates to that degree. The delegates were losing confidence in the president. Uh, they were with him 100%. Um, but after the three weeks of torture, they were out. Not all of them, but enough of them that it would have been an ugly, ugly fight. And Biden would have won, but it would have ripped the party apart. So when Biden talks about like he dropped out because he didn't want to have a divided party, he means it quite literally. He, he doesn't mean like emotionally a divided party. He means an ugly floor fight on the, on the convention floor in Chicago and it would have been nasty and there was always the chance he would have lost, but even if he'd won, it would have been really ugly. And I think Donilon and Ricchetti and Biden just ultimately concluded, like, "These bastards are chasing you out."</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我会说有两个原因。第一，参议员们缺乏支持对他意义重大。参议院只得到了一次会议，嗯，他们想要一次与拜登的会面，但没得到。他们只与他竞选团队在白宫的领导人进行了一次会面，因为他们……顺便说一句，当他们不让拜登参加那次会议时，这非常说明问题。基本上，归结到，在参议院民主党核心小组的51名成员中，只有五名参议员支持拜登。而且有很多民主党人正在竞选连任，他们处境危险，他们的工作真的面临风险。然后我认为，嗯，他一直，他一直被告知民调显示你赢不了，但是你知道，拜登一直说：“我的手下可不是这么说的。”他指的是，他说的不是他的民调员，而是多尼伦和里凯蒂向他描述的民调员的民调，他们不断给出这种不切实际的乐观民调展望。我的意思是，那毫无疑问会是一场惨败。还有一点，在这段时间里，当他们说：“看，他仍然只落后唐纳德·特朗普三四点。我们可以追回来。”那时，你已经有他就是无法追回的记录。你知道，你，你出席了罗伯特·赫尔的新闻发布会，你淹没了全国，你在辩论中失败了。你本可以有更多事情发生。这对我来说是一种疯狂的风险，我看到很多民主党人至少公开表示他们愿意承担这种风险，就是这个人很久以来都不是一个“关键时刻选手”，除了那次有稿子的国情咨文。那种认为你会度过一场艰难的竞选，你必须迎头赶上，而这个人甚至无法接受采访的想法。根本问题在于，民调员最终，他们本应与拜登会面，但后来取消了。所以他们与“内圈”（Palipiro）或进行了一次Zoom会议，他们基本上说的是，你落后的根本原因无法改变。美国人民已经得出结论，你太老了，无法胜任这份工作，你也无法向他们证明并非如此。此时，我们都看到了三点，我的意思是，你不需要是政治学专业或，你知道，一个高薪的幕僚，就能说：“好吧，他辩论表现糟糕。出去，做10场艰难的采访和五场市民大会，解决这个问题。”我的意思是，每个人都知道，但他做不到。最终，那些看到他、给予他怀疑好处的民主党人，查克·舒默等人都得出了这个结论。他做不到。但还有一件事，我认为是决定性的最后一件事，嗯，米尼翁·摩尔负责2024年民主党全国代表大会，她是一位资深的民主党运作人，在这个圈子里非常受尊敬。她上任后，设立了一个非官方小组，叫做“万一委员会”。“万一委员会”的任务是讨论：“嗯，万一拜登退选怎么办？万一抗议活动太严重，他们，呃，他们关闭芝加哥怎么办？”就是任何，任何可能的事情。之所以，呃，在三周左右的时间里，将他换掉并非那么困难，我想那是拜登退选到大会之间大约三周半的时间。之所以不那么困难，是因为米尼翁·摩尔已经决定，他们将把装饰布置得尽可能“平淡无奇”，这样如果需要换上别人的名字，你知道，就不会像，就不会像所有东西都做成特拉华州的样子。这么说吧。“万一委员会”与所有代表保持联系，他们监控着一切，最终在里凯蒂、拜登和多尼伦谈话的那个周末之前，也就是7月21日那个星期天，拜登宣布他不再竞选了。“万一委员会”向“内圈”转达：“你可以在大会上获胜，但那会非常难看。”他们正在失去代表到那种程度。代表们对总统失去了信心。呃，他们曾百分之百支持他。嗯，但在三周的折磨之后，他们放弃了。不是所有人，但有足够多的人放弃了，以至于那将是一场丑陋的、极其难看的斗争。拜登会赢，但那会撕裂整个党派。所以当拜登说他退选是因为他不想让党派分裂时，他是字面意思。他，他指的不是情感上的党派分裂。他指的是在芝加哥党代会现场会有一场丑陋的争吵，那会很糟糕，而且他一直有输掉的可能，但即使他赢了，那也会非常难看。我认为多尼伦、里凯蒂和拜登最终都得出结论，就是：“这些混蛋正在把你赶出去。”</p>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">I want to just talk through some of the lessons of all this. One that has been on my mind is, and I wonder how much you have this experience, how much in the media we prize inside information. And often the truth is just right in front of you. If you are asking people around Biden in 2023 and 2024, "How good is he? How capable is he?" You are being told broadly speaking he's doing great. You have a fascinating little vignette about, you know, his press people pulling members of the administration onto these phone calls to say things that they may not even believe. If you were just watching him at his public appearances, you were getting a more accurate presentation. How do you think about that? How that should make us think about the balance between it. It sure seems very official when you get an anonymous senior administration source in a story. But you know, just watch these guys and listen to them. What they do in public is what tells you what's true.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我只想谈谈这一切的一些教训。我一直在思考的一点是，我想知道你是否有这样的经历，媒体中我们多么看重内部信息。而通常真相就在你眼前。如果你在2023年和2024年问拜登身边的人：“他有多好？他有多能干？”你得到的普遍回答是他表现出色。你有一个引人入胜的小插曲，关于，你知道，他的新闻团队把政府成员拉到这些电话会议上，说一些他们自己可能都不相信的话。如果你只是观察他在公开场合的表现，你会得到一个更准确的呈现。你对此怎么看？这应该如何让我们思考其中的平衡。当你在报道中得到一个匿名的政府高级消息来源时，这看起来确实非常官方。但你知道，只要观察这些人，听听他们说的话。他们在公开场合所做的一切才是告诉你真相的东西。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">I think that's right. We have a senior Democrat in the book in the first chapter who talks about how he would call, seeing, seeing what you're talking about, his inability to communicate in a way that you would want for a president, and he would call inside people, Donilon etc., and they would all say, "He's fine, he's fine, he's fine." And then after Biden dropped out, this Democrat went to the White House and sat down with Joe and Jill Biden, the first lady and the President of the United States, behind closed doors, just the three people. And this Democrat told us, "He wasn't fine. Jill had to complete his sentences. He was losing his train of thought. He wasn't fine." So, I mean, I think one of the things that there, there are a lot of failures in this book. And certainly the news media, it's hard to argue that we were on top of this. Even people like you and me who were questioning this publicly. It's hard to argue that any of us, in retrospect, covered this sufficiently. Although there was, I do, I want to give credit to a bunch of my newsroom colleagues here and and and Alex and others. There were a bunch of stories, there time stories, great Wall Street Journal stories. It was harder to get people to say anything. That's the point. And it's hard, it's hard to get, I mean, you need evidence for stories. Well, look, I mean, we have a, but we were trying to crack this. We. But that's my point is if a president's inner circle is willing to lie, and if they don't even think they're lying, that's an incredibly dangerous thing. I wish I had like a solution. "Here are the three things we need to do." And like then this will never happen again. One of the things that we talk about in the book, and we have Jonathan Reiner, a doctor at GW, who's an adviser to the White House medical office, who says that he thinks the White House medical reports should be affirmed under threat of perjury and given to Congress every year. So that there, there could be no lying or dissembling. But beyond that, what can we do? I, I don't know. But I, I think there are lessons from this that are that are broader even than that. And honestly, to me, they reflect Trump as well as Biden. I think modern political parties have become very personality-driven. They have leaders, and the structure of them is to really fall in behind the leader. That was true to some degree in the Democratic Party. It's true incredibly strongly in the Republican Party. I feel like a big difference even between Trump one and Trump two is that in Trump one, his own staff was willing to tell people all the time that this guy was wrong. He was making crazy arguments. They had to restrain him. Now they see him as kissed by destiny, and you know, how dare you question the sun god. And I think that recognizing as a structural mode of failure that parties have a lot of trouble saying what is just obvious to everybody in front of them is is like is a thing to grapple with because I, I feel like Democrats would not admit what just everybody knew about Joe Biden. And now I'm watching Republicans not admit that, you know, what everybody's always knew about Donald Trump, that he's erratic, he's all over the place, that the stuff he says often doesn't make sense, that he's surrounded by yes-men and sycophants, that the parties have just become too weak. They're they can be so easily taken over by whoever leads them.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我认为这是对的。我们在书的第一章中提到了一位资深的民主党人，他谈到他如何打电话，看到，看到你所说的情况，他无法以总统应有的方式进行沟通，他会打电话给内部人士，多尼伦等人，他们都会说：“他很好，他很好，他很好。”然后在拜登退出竞选后，这位民主党人去了白宫，与乔和吉尔·拜登，第一夫人和美国总统，在密室里坐了下来，就他们三个人。这位民主党人告诉我们：“他一点都不好。吉尔不得不替他完成句子。他正在失去思路。他一点都不好。”所以，我的意思是，我认为这本书中有很多失败之处。当然，新闻媒体，很难说我们对此事了如指掌。即使是你我这样公开质疑的人。很难说我们中的任何一个人，事后看来，充分报道了这一点。尽管有，我确实，我想在这里向我新闻室的一些同事以及亚历克斯和其他人致敬。有很多报道，当时也有报道，很棒的《华尔街日报》报道。但很难让人说出任何话。这就是重点。而且很难，很难得到，我的意思是，报道需要证据。嗯，你看，我的意思是，我们有，但我们试图破解这个问题。我们。但我的观点是，如果总统的核心圈子愿意撒谎，如果他们甚至不认为自己在撒谎，那将是极其危险的事情。我希望我能有一个解决方案。“这是我们需要做的三件事。”然后这种情况就永远不会再发生。我们在书中谈到的一件事，我们有乔纳森·雷纳，一位乔治·华盛顿大学的医生，他是白宫医疗办公室的顾问，他说他认为白宫的医疗报告应该在伪证罪的威胁下每年提交给国会。这样，就不会有谎言或掩饰。但除此之外，我们还能做什么？我，我不知道。但我，我我认为这其中有一些教训，甚至比那更广泛。坦率地说，对我来说，它们既反映了特朗普，也反映了拜登。我认为现代政党已经变得非常以个性为导向。他们有领导人，他们的结构是真正地追随领导人。这在民主党在某种程度上是事实。在共和党，这非常非常强烈地是事实。我觉得即使是特朗普一期和特朗普二期之间的一个巨大差异是，在特朗普一期，他自己的幕僚一直愿意告诉人们这个人错了。他提出疯狂的论点。他们不得不约束他。现在他们把他看作是被命运眷顾的，你知道，你怎么敢质疑太阳神。我认为认识到作为一个结构性失败模式，政党很难说出眼前对每个人来说都显而易见的事情，这是一件需要应对的事情，因为我，我感觉民主党人不会承认每个人都知道的关于乔·拜登的事情。而现在我看到共和党人也不会承认，你知道，每个人一直都知道的关于唐纳德·特朗普的事情，他反复无常，他到处乱来，他所说的话常常没有意义，他被应声虫和马屁精包围着，政党们只是变得太弱了。他们可以如此轻易地被任何领导他们的人接管。</p>

                <p class="english-text">It's not just the parties though, right? It's all of the things, all of the structures that are supposed to, all the institutions that are supposed to structurally check any leader, to one degree or another, failed. I mean, Congress, there are any number of moments that one could point to of interviews or weird moments where, let's say, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer should have marched up to the White House and said, "What the is this? Like, what is going on?" Um, and they didn't. So, it was on them. Uh, but then also like donors should have been able to look at Biden any one of these moments and say what's going on here. But the modern presidency in addition to the weakening of the party, I mean, I'm sure you know the name of the Democratic National Committee chairman during the Biden years, but I bet 99 out of a hundred of your incredibly smart listeners do not. It was Jaime Harrison from South Carolina. And we have a vignette where Biden doesn't even know Jaime Harrison's name. Although, you know what disturbs me so much about that vignette? There was no stronger Biden defender in this period than Harrison. Still to this day saying, you know, when you're what you do is you protect your quarterback from getting sacked, right? Treating this as if the the question is loyalty to this day as opposed to the country itself. I, I thought Jamie Harrison like covered himself in dishonor in this.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">但这不仅仅是党派的问题，对吧？所有的事情，所有应该存在的结构，所有应该对任何领导人进行结构性制约的机构，都在某种程度上失败了。我的意思是，国会，有无数个时刻可以指出，比如采访或奇怪的时刻，哈基姆·杰弗里斯和查克·舒默本应该走到白宫，说：“这到底是什么？到底发生了什么？”嗯，但他们没有。所以，责任在他们。呃，但同样，捐助者本应该在任何这些时刻看到拜登，然后说这里发生了什么。但是现代总统制，除了党派的弱化，我的意思是，我确信你知道拜登任期内民主党全国委员会主席的名字，但我敢打赌你100个极其聪明的听众中99个都不知道。他是来自南卡罗来纳州的杰米·哈里森。我们有一个小插曲，拜登甚至不知道杰米·哈里森的名字。尽管，你知道那个小插曲让我如此不安的是什么吗？在这一时期，没有比哈里森更强大的拜登辩护者了。直到今天他还在说，你知道，你的职责是保护你的四分卫不被擒杀，对吧？将这视为忠诚问题，而不是国家本身的问题。我，我以为杰米·哈里森在这件事上自取其辱。</p>

                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Harrison is still out there saying that the mistake was having Biden step down from the ticket. That's a little bit what I mean when I when I talk about this is a thing people have to begin thinking about in the structures of their parties. I mean, look, Lara Trump was co-chair of the RNC there. I mean, I, I, I think you're right to say Congress is probably where authority to check things like this should lie, and people need to be able to to to speak a bit more freely. But when you look back at just what people were willing to explain away, to cover up, to talk about this as if the point of politics is your loyalty to the politician and not what the country needs from them, right? The number of Democrats who made arguments like, "Joe Biden has had our back, now we have to have his." What the hell does that even mean? The point of the party is to come up with a candidate who is the best person to lead the country. And if you're a Democrat, keep the country out of Donald Trump's hands. Like, this is not some kind of interpersonal payback for years of friendship with Joe Biden or any other president. 100%.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">哈里森还在外面说，错误是让拜登退出了竞选。这就是我所说的，人们必须开始思考在他们党派结构中存在的这种问题。我的意思是，看，拉拉·特朗普是共和党全国委员会的联合主席。我的意思是，我，我，我认为你说得对，国会可能是应该拥有权力来制约这类事情的地方，人们需要能够更自由地发言。但当你回顾人们愿意如何解释、掩盖，谈论这件事，仿佛政治的重点是你对政治家的忠诚，而不是国家需要他们做什么，对吗？有多少民主党人提出这样的论点，比如：“乔·拜登一直支持我们，现在我们必须支持他。”这到底是什么意思？党派的目的是提出一个最适合领导国家的人选。如果你是民主党人，就是把国家从唐纳德·特朗普手中夺回来。这根本不是什么因为与乔·拜登或任何其他总统多年的友谊而进行的个人恩怨回报。100%。</p>

                <p class="english-text">I keep thinking about the Clooney fundraiser, which is in June. And Biden shows up, and the, and the behind-the-scenes Biden is shocking to George Clooney, to Barack Obama, to a whole bunch of people. The only one who said anything was George Clooney. But this is a room full of people who saw this. And Barack Obama is one of them. I'm not blaming Barack Obama, but institutionally there's so much deference given to a president, even by a former president. I don't think it's healthy for this country. So, you're talking about the weakness of the parties, and I agree. I also think that the strength of the presidency in this regard is a problem.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我一直在想六月的那个克鲁尼募款活动。拜登出现了，幕后的拜登令乔治·克鲁尼、巴拉克·奥巴马以及一大群人感到震惊。唯一说了点什么的是乔治·克鲁尼。但这是一个充满了看到这一切的人的房间。巴拉克·奥巴马就是其中之一。我不是在责怪巴拉克·奥巴马，但在体制上，即便是前总统，对现任总统也有太多的尊重。我认为这对这个国家不健康。所以，你谈论的是党派的弱点，我同意。我也认为总统职位的这种权力强度是个问题。</p>

                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Well, in a way, no one is saying anything because no one is saying anything. This, it's such an obvious dynamic that it barely bears pointing out. But people look to each other to see what is safe to say. And if you watch Dean Phillips get defenestrated by the party, if it seems clear that you'll be profoundly on the outs and if you don't think you saying anything will do anything. Even people who would privately tell me they understood how bad this problem was. What kept them from saying anything on some level in addition to careerism was fatalism. "Nothing's going to change. Joe Biden's not stepping aside. It's impossible." So to say anything about it is simply to weaken him against Donald Trump. Well, there's to admit what is in front of your face is to empower the other side. That's certainly, and that became a very powerful enforcement mechanism inside the party.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，在某种程度上，没有人说任何话是因为没有人说任何话。这太明显了，几乎不值一提。但人们会互相观望，看看什么话是安全的。如果你看到迪安·菲利普斯被党派“开除”，如果看起来你将彻底被边缘化，而且如果你认为你说了什么也无济于事。即使是那些私下里会告诉我他们明白这个问题有多严重的人。除了职业主义，某种程度上阻止他们说任何话的是宿命论。“什么都不会改变。乔·拜登不会退出的。那是不可能的。”所以，说任何关于它的事，都只会削弱他对阵唐纳德·特朗普的力量。嗯，承认摆在你眼前的事实就是给对方赋能。这当然，这在党内变成了一个非常强大的强制机制。</p>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Right. And in this time of silos and social media, the fear of being labeled, "Oh, MAGA Ezra," or whatever, when Annie and Siobhan, the great Wall Street Journal reporters, put out their piece about Biden behind the scenes, the degree to which Dean Phillips was defenestrated, Annie and Siobhan got kneecapped. I'm sure it wasn't pleasant when you did your things. I know it wasn't pleasant when I did mine. Alex, the same. No, you felt like you were destroying all of your relationships with the White House all at once. Yeah. And, yeah. And not just, I mean, I'm not saying the White House, with the Democratic Party, with the Democratic Party. And I'm not saying it was literally that bad, but I mean I, I did, I was fairly public on this, and it was a bigger firestorm of pushback coming from, I would say, like privately a lot of people said, "Oh, you're right." In the email inbox, like just normal people like, "Oh, thank God somebody is saying something." But then people I thought of as sort of friends who are like liberally aligned pundits or, um, you know, people in in politics proper in public, even people I knew who believe this stuff in private were absolutely flaying me. And that was to me the most shocking part, having people who I'd had a version of this conversation with in private then slam me in public when I said it publicly. There is a Democratic operative in our book who defended Biden publicly, who says to us on background that Biden stole an election from the Democratic Party and from the American people. This person has only publicly said positive things about Joe Biden. I mean, this is where we are. Where truth-telling of any sort, because we're so tribal and in camps, um, is legitimately a career ender or at least a risk. Robert Hur could not find work after being special counsel. He, he finally did months later, but the word went out, "Don't hire him." I mean, it's nasty. Look, it the same thing is going on now in terms of anybody questioning Trump, although it's more, you know, questioning what he's doing with, you know, it's more policy oriented, at least at this stage. But none of it's healthy for a republic to be able to, and I don't think it, by the way, that it's like this in other democracies. I think there's much more room for debate in other democracies, whether England or France. I mean, it seems like they have more room for interparty criticism or even the notion that journalists or commentators are allowed to say things without not being able to feed their families.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">对。在这个信息孤岛和社交媒体的时代，被贴上“哦，MAGA埃兹拉”之类的标签的恐惧，当《华尔街日报》的优秀记者安妮和西奥班发布他们关于拜登幕后的报道时，迪安·菲利普斯被“清除”的程度，安妮和西奥班受到了打击。我相信你做那些事的时候也不愉快。我知道我做我的事的时候也不愉快。亚历克斯也是。不，你觉得你一下子毁掉了你与白宫的所有关系。是的。而且，是的。我不只是说白宫，而是与民主党，与民主党。我不是说情况真的那么糟糕，但我的意思是，我确实，我在这件事上相当公开，并且引发了更大的反弹风暴，我会说，私下里很多人都说：“哦，你说的对。”在电子邮件收件箱里，就像普通人一样，说：“哦，谢天谢地有人说出来了。”但那些我曾认为是朋友的人，那些自由派的评论员，或者，嗯，你知道，在公共场合的政治人物，甚至我认识的那些私下里相信这些事情的人，都在公开场合对我进行猛烈抨击。这对我来说是最令人震惊的部分，那些我私下里和他们进行过这种对话的人，当我在公开场合说出来时，却在公开场合抨击我。我们书里有一个民主党特工，他在公开场合为拜登辩护，但私下里告诉我们，拜登从民主党和美国人民手中窃取了一场选举。这个人只在公开场合对乔·拜登说过好话。我的意思是，我们现在就是这样。任何形式的讲真话，因为我们是如此部落化和阵营化，嗯，这确实是职业生涯的终结，或者至少是一种风险。罗伯特·赫尔在担任特别检察官后找不到工作。他，他几个月后才找到工作，但消息传开了：“不要雇佣他。”我的意思是，这很糟糕。看，现在任何质疑特朗普的人，也正在发生同样的事情，尽管更多的是，你知道，质疑他在做什么，你知道，更多是政策导向的，至少在这个阶段是这样。但这些都不利于一个共和国的健康发展，顺便说一句，我也不认为其他民主国家也是这样。我认为其他民主国家有更多的辩论空间，无论是英国还是法国。我的意思是，他们似乎有更多的党内批评空间，甚至记者或评论员被允许说一些话而不至于无法养家糊口。</p>

                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Well, it also reflects different political systems. So in a lot of the systems, the, you know, they're parliamentary and the party leader is chosen by, you know, the party elites and the, you know, the people in parliament. And if the person loses the confidence of his supporters or her supporters, they're out. And they get, I mean, we just have watched the UK go through a bunch of different, um, party leaders in in in both parties, uh, in the last couple of years. And I think here the division between we choose with primaries, which is not how, you know, we've done it for most of American history. This is sort of one of the whole arguments about open conventions that like we actually did used to pick people at conventions. It's not a completely unknown thing to do.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，它也反映了不同的政治制度。所以在很多制度中，你知道，它们是议会制的，党魁是由，你知道，党内精英和，你知道，议会中的人选出来的。如果这个人失去了他的支持者或她的支持者的信任，他们就被淘汰了。他们会，我的意思是，我们刚刚看到英国在过去几年里，两个主要政党都经历了一系列不同的党魁更迭。我认为在这里，我们通过初选进行选择的这种划分，这与，你知道，美国历史上大部分时间以来的做法不同。这有点像是关于开放式党代会的所有论点之一，就是我们过去确实习惯于在党代会上挑选人选。这不是一个完全未知的事情。</p>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Jake Tapper:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Yeah. But it was convention structure, but it was back.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。但那是会议结构，但它回来了。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="speaker-segment">
                <span class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</span>
                <p class="english-text">Right. But that's what I mean, that I think one reason in some other countries it's easier to to deal with these problems, if you believe it is, is that more power is still in the back room. I think we have both quite irresponsible political elites in this country, but we also have quite weak ones. And I think those two things exist in relationship to each other. That elite failures are most obvious when elite power is most degraded. I don't think elites were some grand class of hyper-competent, uh, guardians of the public trust in the, you know, 1950s or the 1940s or the 1930s. But among other things, they had more privacy and they had more power. The closest we got to that in the last few decades was in 2020 when the elites got involved because they feared a Bernie Sanders nomination and rallied around Joe Biden. And they didn't do it because they liked Joe Biden. They did it because they thought Joe Biden could beat Bernie and then Trump. And that was just strictly on the numbers. Who can win college-educated white voters in the suburbs of Philly and also black voters in South Carolina? And there was only one person who was running who could do that. And it was Biden. And so, and we'll never know probably the extent to which Barack Obama and others like called Buttigieg and Klobuchar and Booker and Warren and all the others and encouraged them to drop out and get behind Biden. But it did happen, and that's the closest we've gotten to a smoke-filled room in my lifetime.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">对。但这就是我的意思，我认为在其他一些国家，处理这些问题更容易的一个原因（如果你相信是这样的话），就是权力仍然更多地掌握在幕后。我认为我们这个国家的政治精英既相当不负责任，但也相当软弱。而且我认为这两者是相互关联的。精英的失败在精英权力最受侵蚀时最为明显。我不认为精英在1950年代、1940年代或1930年代是某种拥有超强能力、捍卫公众信任的伟大阶层。但除其他因素外，他们拥有更多的隐私，也拥有更大的权力。过去几十年来我们最接近这种情况的，是在2020年，当时精英们介入，因为他们害怕伯尼·桑德斯获得提名，于是团结在乔·拜登周围。他们这样做并非因为喜欢乔·拜登。他们这样做是因为他们认为乔·拜登可以击败伯尼，然后击败特朗普。这完全是基于数字的。谁能赢得费城郊区受过大学教育的白人选民以及南卡罗来纳州的黑人选民？当时只有一个人参选可以做到这一点。那就是拜登。所以，我们可能永远不会知道巴拉克·奥巴马和其他人打电话给布蒂吉格、克洛布查尔、布克和沃伦以及所有其他人，鼓励他们退选并支持拜登的程度。但它的确发生了，那是我一生中我们最接近“烟雾弥漫的房间”的一次。</p>

                <p class="chinese-text">我的意思是，我在这里要给民主党一些赞扬。它最终在2024年发生了。发生得太晚了。但该党做了一些非常不寻常的事情，把他从竞选名单上推了下来。确实说服他不要参选。</p>

"You can always count on them to do the right thing after they've exhausted every other possible option." I think it's a place to end. Then always a final question. What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，这就像丘吉尔谈论美国时说的：“你总能指望他们耗尽所有其他可能的选项后，做正确的事情。”我想这里可以结束了。然后总是一个最后的问题。你会向听众推荐哪三本书？</p>

                <p class="english-text">Oh, such a great question. I, I, I assume abundance is implied. Um, I am reading right now, and this is a fun diversion if you are, if you're like me and you spend too much time lying in bed doom scrolling. Um, Susan Morrison has a book called *Lorne*, which is about Lorne Michaels and the history of Saturday Night Live, which is great. Um, there's a book called *Hitler's People*, I think it's called, um, by Richard Evans that I'm reading also, which is about how it came to be that the Holocaust happened in Germany, and it's kind of like a, if anybody out there read Goldhagen's *Hitler's Willing Executioners*, which is very damning of the German people, it's kind of building on that scholarship, like, "What is it about Germany that this happened there?" And then just because, uh, I am also a fan of graphic novels, I will say that, um, there is a graphic novel that is written by Andy Samberg and some others with him called *The Holy Roller*, which is about a Jewish bowling Ohio superhero that I have started and is enjoyable and weird.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">哦，真是个好问题。我，我，我想丰富性是隐含的。嗯，我目前正在读一本书，如果你像我一样花太多时间躺在床上刷着负面新闻，那么这本书是一个有趣的消遣。嗯，苏珊·莫里森有一本叫《洛恩》的书，是关于洛恩·迈克尔斯和《周六夜现场》的历史的，很棒。嗯，还有一本叫《希特勒的人民》，我想是这个名字，嗯，是理查德·埃文斯写的，我也在读，讲的是大屠杀是如何在德国发生的，有点像，如果外面有人读过戈德哈根的《希特勒的自愿刽子手》，那本书对德国人民的批判很强烈，这本是在那个学术基础上进一步探讨，比如，“德国有什么特别之处，让这一切发生在那里？”然后，仅仅因为，呃，我也是图画小说的爱好者，我会说，嗯，有一本由安迪·萨姆伯格和其他几位与他合著的图画小说，叫做《神圣滚轴》，讲的是一个犹太裔俄亥俄州保龄球超级英雄的故事，我已经开始读了，既有趣又奇怪。</p>
