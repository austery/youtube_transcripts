            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Hi everyone. Today I have the honor of speaking with Professor Ervand Abrahamian, a renowned historian of Iran and Middle East history. Born in Tehran and educated at Oxford and Colombia, Professor Abrahamian has taught at prestigious institutions like Princeton, NYU, and Colombia. He is the author of several influential books such as *Iran Between Two Revolutions* and *The Oil Crisis in Iran*, providing very deep insight into the region's complex history. Professor, thank you so much for joining my show.</p>
                <p>I recently read your book *The 1953 Coup* and I found that book really fascinating. I think anyone who is interested in Iran's modern history should definitely read that book. And I found, given your extensive research on that coup, how would you say it set the stage for the modern US and Iran relationships?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>大家好。今天我很荣幸能与厄尔凡德·阿布拉哈米安教授对话，他是一位著名的伊朗和中东历史学家。阿布拉哈米安教授出生于德黑兰，在牛津大学和哥伦比亚大学接受教育，曾在普林斯顿大学、纽约大学和哥伦比亚大学等著名学府任教。他著有数本极具影响力的书籍，如《两次革命之间的伊朗》和《伊朗的石油危机》，为该地区复杂历史提供了深刻的见解。教授，非常感谢您能参加我的节目。</p>
                <p>我最近读了您的著作《1953年政变》，发现这本书非常引人入胜。我认为任何对伊朗现代史感兴趣的人都绝对应该读这本书。基于您对那次政变的广泛研究，您认为它如何为现代美伊关系奠定了基础？</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="interview-block">
            <p class="speaker-name">厄尔凡德·阿布拉哈米安:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Thank you for the invitation. Well, it's the background to it, but I don't think it sort of fixes the inevitable conflict between Iran and the US. It was something that, of course, in Iran people were aware of it. It doesn't mean that there was an ingrained anti-Americanism. In fact, I think after the revolution, after 1979, there were quite a few attempts, even by the Iranian regime headed by the president, of reaching out to the United States for some sort of normalization. But it was often actually on the American side, often pressured by Israel not to normalize relations, hoping to have some sort of regime change. And also, of course, the hostage crisis, when after the revolution, the Iranian students took over the US embassy and took a number of diplomats hostage. That created a bad taste in Washington, and a lot of people haven't forgiven Iran for that. Basically, they consider it a major crime. But I think Iranians were much more willing to forget or put aside 1953, while the US was not so willing to put aside the hostage crisis.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>感谢您的邀请。嗯，这件事是背景，但我不认为它决定了伊朗和美国之间不可避免的冲突。当然，在伊朗，人们是知道这件事的。但这并不意味着存在根深蒂固的反美主义。事实上，我认为在革命之后，也就是1979年之后，即使是由总统领导的伊朗政权，也曾多次尝试与美国接触，以寻求某种形式的关系正常化。但问题往往出在美国方面，他们常常受到以色列的压力，要求其不要与伊朗关系正常化，希望能够实现某种政权更迭。当然，还有人质危机，革命后，伊朗学生占领了美国大使馆，并将多名外交官扣为人质。这在华盛顿留下了不好的印象，很多人至今没有原谅伊朗。他们基本上认为这是一项重罪。但我认为，伊朗人更愿意忘记或搁置1953年的事件，而美国则不那么愿意搁置人质危机。</p>

        <h3>摩萨德格的历史形象与政策</h3>

        <div class="interview-block">
            <p class="speaker-name">王路飞:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Yeah, I kind of see that it's a very complex situation between the US and Iran after all these different events and accidents. I think in that book, the Prime Minister at that time, Mohammad Mosaddegh, his historical image is generally positive in the minds of the Iranian people. Is that correct?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>是的，我能理解，在经历了所有这些不同的事件和意外之后，美伊之间的局势非常复杂。我认为在那本书中，当时的总理穆罕默德·摩萨德格，他在伊朗人民心中的历史形象通常是正面的。这个说法正确吗？</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-block">
            <p class="speaker-name">厄尔凡德·阿布拉哈米安:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Well, yes. I think he's often known for having nationalized the Iranian oil company from the British. So he's seen as a father of the nation because by nationalizing the oil, it was seen as a sort of declaration of independence for Iran from British colonialism. You know, in other countries, there was a declaration of independence after World War II. Iran felt that they were, if not a full colony, a semi-colony of Britain because so much of the natural resources, oil, were actually under British ownership. So taking over the oil company was equivalent to basically a declaration of independence from the British. This gave Mosaddegh a great deal of popular appeal. But added to that is another issue that is often forgotten abroad. He also epitomized the ideals of the constitutional revolution of 1906, which were the ideals of basically the European enlightenment—of liberalism, equality, liberty, parliamentary government. A monarch would be one that would reign, not rule. So in many ways, he brought together these ideals of Iranian both national independence and also of basically some sort of democracy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>是的。我认为他广为人知是因为他将伊朗的石油公司从英国人手中收归国有。因此，他被视为国父，因为将石油国有化被看作是伊朗摆脱英国殖民主义、宣告独立的一种方式。要知道，在其他国家，二战后都有独立的宣言。而伊朗感觉自己即便不是一个完全的殖民地，也是英国的半殖民地，因为大量的自然资源，特别是石油，实际上都归英国所有。所以，接管石油公司基本上等同于向英国宣告独立。这为摩萨德格赢得了大量的民众支持。但除此之外，还有一个在国外常常被遗忘的问题。他还体现了1906年宪政革命的理想，这些理想基本上源于欧洲启蒙运动——即自由主义、平等、自由、议会制政府。君主应该是“临朝而不理政”的。因此，在很多方面，他融合了伊朗民族独立和某种形式的民主这两种理想。</p>

        <div class="interview-block">
            <p class="speaker-name">王路飞:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Yeah. I also made a video about your book on that topic and there are some audience members who criticized me for saying the author is over-glorifying Mosaddegh's historical image. Do you think your book has that tendency or do you think you have a very balanced view of his policies and his historical image?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>是的。我也就您的书和这个话题做了一期视频，有些观众批评我说作者过分美化了摩萨德格的历史形象。您认为您的书有这种倾向吗？还是您认为您对他的政策和历史形象持有一个非常平衡的观点？</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-block">
            <p class="speaker-name">厄尔凡德·阿布拉哈米安:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Well, no, I think it depends who you talk to. But for all the Shah's reign, in fact, he was a non-person. Mosaddegh was never even mentioned in the press as if he never existed. And anything that there was during his basic period or the whole of that era before '53 was seen as a sort of chaotic, bad period that you shouldn't really admire. But there's always been this admiration for Mosaddegh. And ironically, now, in some ways, his ideas are more actually contemporary because his ideals of equality, liberty, some sort of civil society, democracy, is what a lot of people in Iran want. And their criticism of the Islamic Republic is that it has actually strayed from these ideals of the enlightenment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>嗯，不，我认为这取决于你和谁谈。但在沙阿（Shah，指伊朗国王巴列维）的整个统治时期，事实上，他（摩萨德格）是一个不存在的人。媒体上从未提及摩萨德格，就好像他从未存在过一样。他执政的那个时期，或者说53年之前的整个时代，都被描绘成一个混乱、糟糕的时期，不值得钦佩。但人们对摩萨德格的钦佩一直存在。而且讽刺的是，在某些方面，他的思想在现在实际上更具时代意义，因为他所倡导的平等、自由、公民社会、民主等理想，正是许多伊朗人现在所渴望的。而他们对伊斯兰共和国的批评，恰恰在于它偏离了这些启蒙运动的理想。</p>

        <div class="interview-block">
            <p class="speaker-name">王路飞:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>So do you think like at that time given Mosaddegh's position and his popularity with all the populist groups, like all the people in Iran, his policy towards nationalizing the oil field is a little bit too aggressive? What if he negotiated better with the US and Great Britain? Maybe he could actually exercise his ideology for pushing for democracy and liberty in Iran.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>那么您认为，在当时，考虑到摩萨德格的地位以及他在所有民粹主义团体和伊朗人民中的声望，他将油田国有化的政策是否有些过于激进？如果他能与美国和英国进行更好的谈判，或许他就能真正在伊朗推行其民主和自由的理念了。</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="interview-block">
            <p class="speaker-name">厄尔凡德·阿布拉哈米安:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Well, his priority, his main thing was the nationalization, and that's why he became prime minister. He was elected in order to implement the nationalization law. No, he was willing to actually negotiate with the West, especially with the British oil company, for some settlement where he would basically compensate for nationalization. So it wasn't like he was intransigent and refused. He was built up in the Western press as a sort of erratic man who refused to negotiate. In fact, when you look at the documents, the intransigence actually came from Britain and then also from the US. They were willing to talk softly, to talk about, yes, they accept the principle of oil nationalization. But when it came to the crux, and this is what I found in the documents, and the press never admitted that at the time, was that when it came to the crux, the Americans supported the British position that Iran under no condition should control its own resource oil industry, which means actually refusal to accept nationalization. In fact, some oil executives in America said it would be even better for America for Iran to become communist rather than succeed in nationalizing oil.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>嗯，他的首要任务，他最主要的事情就是国有化，这也是他成为总理的原因。他被选上台就是为了实施国有化法律。不，他实际上是愿意与西方，特别是与英国石油公司进行谈判的，以达成某种解决方案，他会为国有化提供补偿。所以他并非不妥协、拒绝谈判。西方媒体将他塑造成一个行为古怪、拒绝谈判的人。事实上，当你查阅文件时，你会发现，不妥协的态度实际上来自英国，然后也来自美国。他们口头上愿意温和地谈论，说他们接受石油国有化的原则。但到了关键时刻，这是我在文件中发现的，而当时的媒体从未承认过，那就是在关键时刻，美国人支持了英国的立场，即伊朗在任何情况下都不应控制自己的石油资源产业，这实际上就意味着拒绝接受国有化。事实上，美国一些石油公司高管甚至说，对美国而言，让伊朗变成共产主义国家，也比让它成功实现石油国有化要好。</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="interview-block">
            <p class="speaker-name">王路飞:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Really? So that actually contradicts the American narrative, because they were saying that at that time the US government was afraid that Iran may fall into the Soviet Union's, you know, their communist wing, so they try to push this coup to kind of prevent that.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>真的吗？这实际上与美国的叙事相矛盾，因为他们当时声称，美国政府担心伊朗可能会落入苏联的共产主义阵营，所以他们试图推动这次政变来阻止这种情况发生。</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="interview-block">
            <p class="speaker-name">厄尔凡德·阿布拉哈米安:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Yes. I mean, they said there wasn't really a coup. There was a counter-coup because the communists were about to carry out a coup. But if Mosaddegh had given up nationalization, basically said, "Okay, I claim I have nationalized it, but you can run the oil company," then of course he wouldn't have been overthrown. There would have been no reason for it. So from that point of view, yes, people are right. If Mosaddegh had basically given up his principle, then there would have been no need for a coup d'état.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>是的。我的意思是，他们说那其实不是一场政变，而是一场反政变，因为共产党人正准备发动政变。但如果摩萨德格放弃了国有化，基本上说：“好吧，我声称已经国有化了，但你们可以继续经营石油公司”，那么他当然不会被推翻。那就没有理由发动政变了。所以从这个角度来看，是的，人们说得对。如果摩萨德格基本上放弃了他的原则，那么就没有必要发动政变了。</p>

                <p>Yeah. So I kind of see that. I mean, I feel very sad after reading that story. I think he's a person with a highly moral standard, but that kind of person may not be suitable for the highest-ranked political position. I think if he had been a little bit corrupted, he could have been bought by the US and Great Britain's politicians or company officials. Then he could potentially push forward his democracy agenda. I don't know if you agree with that kind of perspective. I just feel a little bit sad for what happened to him. It's like a tragedy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>是的。我有点理解了。读完那个故事后，我感到非常难过。我认为他是一个道德标准极高的人，但这样的人可能不适合担任最高级别的政治职位。我想，如果他稍微腐败一点，他可能会被美国和英国的政客或公司官员收买。那样的话，他或许就能推进他的民主议程了。我不知道您是否同意这种观点。我只是为他所遭遇的一切感到有些悲伤。这就像一出悲剧。</p>

                <p>Yeah. Now, one of the parts of his charisma, and I think that's important because his personality actually could override other issues, was his incorruptibility. Other politicians in Iran, especially the Shah, were seen as corrupt, but he was seen as non-corrupt. So if he had basically given up nationalization and said, "Okay, well, I'll forget about that and I'll talk only about democracy," he would have lost his charisma because people would now see him as being actually bought by the British to sell out the national goal for the benefit of remaining in power.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>是的。他个人魅力的一部分，我认为这一点很重要，因为他的个性实际上可以超越其他问题，那就是他的廉洁。伊朗的其他政客，特别是沙阿，被认为是腐败的，而他则被视为清廉。所以，如果他基本上放弃了国有化，说：“好吧，我忘了那回事，我只谈民主”，他就会失去他的个人魅力，因为人们会认为他实际上是被英国人收买了，为了保住权力而出卖了国家目标。</p>

                <p>Got it. So do you think, I saw some critics saying that given his, Mosaddegh's, populist tendencies and the potential dictatorial risk, he may become a dictator if he had really kind of pushed forward his agenda and then controlled the whole government. Do you think that's a reasonable argument?</p>

            <div class="original-text">
                <p>No, I think he was very strongly committed to, I would say, the constitution and democratic rights, as he was to nationalization. You can see this in many places. When he was prime minister, he did not actually use censorship to silence the opposition. There were opposition newspapers all the way through. And he worked through parliament. What is often taken as his dictatorial policy was calling for a referendum to close the Majlis <span class="tooltip">(术语: Majlis，伊朗伊斯兰议会)</span>. And what I've discovered, actually, in a follow-up book from the coup book, is that the Americans and the British were working very closely with deputies in the Majlis to basically bring the government to a standstill. Every time he tried to pass a bill, they would walk out and there wouldn't be a quorum. So the result was basically the government had come to a stalemate. And to avoid that, he went to the public directly and asked for a referendum to close the Majlis so he could have a new Majlis. And this was the main argument that royalists use, that he was being dictatorial because there was nothing about a referendum in the constitution. Therefore, he was going outside the constitution to bypass the constitution. And for some people at that time, this was an issue because, of course, it was unconstitutional. But with hindsight, you see, often, of course, the Shah himself, when he wanted to do something drastic, he went for a referendum.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>不，我认为他对宪法和民主权利的承诺，与他对国有化的承诺同样坚定。这在很多地方都能看出来。当他担任总理时，他并没有真正使用审查制度来压制反对派。反对派的报纸一直都存在。而且他通过议会来工作。通常被认为是他的独裁政策的，是呼吁举行公投来解散议会（Majlis，伊朗伊斯兰议会）。而我实际上在政变那本书的续作中发现，美国人和英国人当时正与议会中的代表们密切合作，目的就是让政府陷入停滞。每次他试图通过一项法案，他们就会离场，导致无法达到法定人数。结果就是政府基本上陷入了僵局。为了避免这种情况，他直接诉诸于公众，要求举行公投解散议会，以便他能组建一个新的议会。而这正是保皇派用来指责他独裁的主要论据，因为宪法中并没有关于公投的规定。因此，他是在宪法之外行事，以绕过宪法。对于当时的一些人来说，这确实是个问题，因为这当然是违宪的。但事后看来，你会发现，当然，沙阿自己，当他想做一些激进的事情时，也常常诉诸于公投。</p>

                <p>Yeah. I kind of see, I agree with your argument. I think if you criticize Mosaddegh, I think he should have been more dictatorial to really survive. If he didn't, part of his reason he failed as a government overturned by the coup is like he's not a dictator. Also, I mean, three days before the successful coup, there was an attempted coup, and the leaders of the coup were all arrested. Some of his advisors said you should execute them. And he said, "You must be crazy. You can't execute someone because they claimed they were taking orders from the Shah." Because that's what they claimed they were doing. So he was very much abiding by the law. During his reign, you can't really find any cases of any of his opponents actually being killed or tortured or imprisoned purely because they were against his policies. People were actually quite openly critical of his policies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>是的。我能理解，我同意您的论点。我认为如果你要批评摩萨德格，那他其实应该更独裁一些才能真正生存下来。他之所以失败，政府被政变推翻，部分原因就在于他不是一个独裁者。另外，在成功政变的三天前，曾有过一次未遂的政变，政变的领导人都被逮捕了。他的一些顾问建议他应该处决他们。而他说：“你们一定是疯了。你不能因为他们声称是奉沙阿的命令而处决他们。”因为那正是他们声称自己在做的事情。所以他非常遵守法律。在他执政期间，你几乎找不到任何反对者仅仅因为反对他的政策而被杀害、折磨或监禁的案例。人们实际上可以相当公开地批评他的政策。</p>

                <p>Yeah, I kind of see the similar... I don't know if you learned about the Chinese history. During the... after they overthrew the Qing dynasty, they tried to do a similar kind of push for democracy. And at that time, there is a kind of contradiction. So if your government is too liberal, you allow for criticizing views, it's very easy to overthrow a government. So you give too much liberty to the media, then your government is prone to this kind of coup planned by interest groups.</p>

            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Well, actually, that's very pertinent because what the coup did, besides remove Mosaddegh, it also undermined the whole admiration for liberal democracy. Because many people said, well, if you actually are not tough, then imperial powers can always overthrow you. That's a reasonable argument given all the activities happening at the time, which I think is pretty sad because US and Britain, their neocon ideology is like, "Oh, we're going to spread this democracy all over the world," but at the same time, they are trying to overthrow all the government they don't like. Exactly. In fact, you can see this after the Islamic Revolution. On the anniversary of Mosaddegh's death, there was a huge demonstration of pro-Mosaddegh people criticizing the Islamic Republic. And Khamenei, who's now the supreme leader, was at that time the main preacher in Tehran. He gave a speech and he didn't want to use Mosaddegh's name because they were still in a way scared of the ghost of Mosaddegh. He said, "We're not Allende, the Chilean president. We're not liberals like Allende that could be snuffed out by the imperialists."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>嗯，实际上，这非常切题，因为那次政变除了推翻摩萨德格，还削弱了人们对自由民主的整体推崇。因为许多人说，如果你不够强硬，那么帝国主义强权就总能推翻你。考虑到当时发生的所有活动，这是一个合理的论点，我觉得这很可悲，因为美国和英国，他们的新保守主义意识形态是：“哦，我们要在全世界传播民主”，但同时，他们却在试图推翻所有他们不喜欢的政府。确实如此。事实上，在伊斯兰革命之后你也能看到这一点。在摩萨德格逝世的周年纪念日，有一次支持摩萨德格的大规模示威活动，人们批评伊斯兰共和国。而现任最高领袖哈梅内伊，当时是德黑兰的主要布道者。他发表了一篇演讲，但他不想提及摩萨德格的名字，因为在某种程度上，他们仍然害怕摩萨德格的幽灵。他说：“我们不是阿连德，那位智利总统。我们不是像阿连德那样的自由主义者，可以被帝国主义者轻易扼杀。”</p>

        <h3>官方历史叙事与审查制度</h3>

        <div class="interview-block">
            <p class="speaker-name">王路飞:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Yeah, because the government is actually using that narrative to suppress different opinions, right? And I actually want to shift the gear a little bit towards the current Iran situation. So one of my audience asked a question: in today's Iranian primary and secondary school textbooks, how do they portray the modern Iranian history, especially the revolution period? Who do they set as a positive figure and who do they set as a negative figure when they describe that part of history, like maybe from 1953 to the current timeframe?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>是的，因为政府实际上在利用这种叙事来压制不同意见，对吧？我其实想把话题稍微转向当前的伊朗局势。我的一位观众提了一个问题：在当今伊朗的中小学教科书中，他们是如何描绘伊朗现代史的，特别是革命时期？当他们描述那段历史，比如从1953年到现在的这段时间，他们将谁设定为正面人物，又将谁设定为负面人物？</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-block">
            <p class="speaker-name">厄尔凡德·阿布拉哈米安:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Well, the narrative of the Islamic Republic is basically fitting or distorting history to fit their own ideological position. For them, the Islamic revolution really started in 1963 when Khomeini opposed the Shah, and therefore the real opposition to the Shah was always the Islamic movement. Which is true, but there were other elements there. And so they start basically, often in history, where you start talking is often set to the conclusion of what you're going to end. So for them, the opposition to the Shah from before '63 was not important. Basically, they don't talk about the 1953 coup then. They also try to avoid talking about Mosaddegh. If they talk, when they talk about '53 or earlier, they focus on some of the religious leaders who first supported Mosaddegh and then didn't. So they see again the real impetus in the nationalization movement as being the clergy rather than Mosaddegh.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>嗯，伊斯兰共和国的叙事基本上是为了迎合或扭曲历史，以符合其自身的意识形态立场。对他们而言，伊斯兰革命真正始于1963年，当时霍梅尼反对沙阿，因此，对沙阿的真正反对力量始终是伊斯兰运动。这在一定程度上是事实，但当时也存在其他因素。所以，他们基本上是从这里开始讲起，通常在历史叙述中，你从哪里开始讲，往往就决定了你最终的结论。所以对他们来说，63年以前对沙阿的反对并不重要。基本上，他们就不谈1953年的政变。他们也试图避免谈论摩萨德格。如果他们谈论，当他们谈论53年或更早时期时，他们会关注一些起初支持摩萨德格后来又不支持的宗教领袖。所以他们再次将国有化运动的真正推动力归功于神职人员，而不是摩萨德格。</p>

                <p>So I'm curious, is your book banned in Iran?</p>

            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Oh no, actually politics often comes into the censorship there. It originally was banned, and then when you had the election of Khatami, you may remember who was the liberal president, he liberalized the censorship. And then some of the academics in Tehran actually had already translated the earlier book *Iran Between Two Revolutions*. So as soon as Khatami came in, the book *Iran Between Two Revolutions* was published and actually quickly became a bestseller. Not because it was good, but because there was so little published on Iranian history. People were starving to know what had happened in the past. So yeah, that was. And then more recently, the book on the coup, again during a more open period, was translated and published. The follow-up book to the coup on the new documents came out from the State Department on the '53 period, that book was translated by someone I know in Tehran. He took it to the censorship office, the Ministry of Guidance, and at first they vetoed it. He said, "Well, what parts of the book do you object to?" They said, "There's nothing we object to in the book. Our objection is the author." But a year later, the same Ministry of Guidance changed its position. So why is not clear. So it's now published.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>哦不，实际上政治因素经常影响那里的审查制度。我的书最初是被禁止的，但后来哈塔米当选，你可能记得那位自由派总统，他放宽了审查制度。然后，德黑兰的一些学者实际上已经翻译了我早期的著作《两次革命之间的伊朗》。所以哈塔米一上台，《两次革命之间的伊朗》就出版了，并且很快成为畅销书。不是因为它写得好，而是因为当时关于伊朗历史的出版物太少了。人们渴望了解过去发生了什么。所以是的，就是这样。然后，最近，关于政变的那本书，也是在一个更开放的时期被翻译和出版了。关于53年时期国务院新文件的政变续作，由我在德黑兰认识的人翻译。他把书稿送到审查办公室，也就是指导部，起初他们否决了。他说：“嗯，你们反对书的哪些部分？”他们说：“我们对书的内容没有任何异议，我们反对的是作者。”但一年后，同一个指导部改变了立场。原因尚不清楚。所以现在它已经出版了。</p>

        <h3>伊斯兰革命卫队（IRGC）与政治军事化</h3>

            <p class="speaker-name">王路飞:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>The second question from my audience is, they're saying Iranian politics seem to increasingly become militarized, with the former IRGC commanders now occupying key positions in both the government and the parliament. Do you see the Guard still primarily serving the supreme leader, or has it evolved into a senior partner or even the main driver of the state policy? How do you think Iran may become a militarized government instead of the current regime?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>我观众的第二个问题是，他们说伊朗政治似乎日益军事化，前伊斯兰革命卫队（IRGC）的指挥官现在在政府和议会中都占据着关键职位。您认为卫队仍然主要服务于最高领袖，还是已经演变成一个高级合作伙伴，甚至是国家政策的主要驱动者？您认为伊朗未来会如何演变成一个军事化政府，而不是目前的政权形式？</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-block">
            <p class="speaker-name">厄尔凡德·阿布拉哈米安:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Yeah, I mean the power structure is still very much in what the Rahbar, the leader—I mean, often the Western press calls him the supreme leader, actually he's known as the leader—so he has basically his key positions, especially the military. So you can't describe it yet as a military establishment. But I would say the main instrument of power is the Revolutionary Guards. So that's the main institution. But in terms of having some legitimacy, it's still based on basically the revolution of '79 and the idea that they represent. So the clerics are still very much allied with the Revolutionary Guards. But if things unravel and become worse, let's say Khamenei is assassinated, then I think the real power will shift to the Revolutionary Guards. So it will become a military establishment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>是的，权力结构仍然很大程度上掌握在“拉赫巴尔”（Rahbar），即领袖手中——西方媒体常称他为最高领袖，但实际上他被称为领袖。他掌握着关键职位，特别是军队。所以你还不能将其描述为一个军事机构。但我会说，权力的主要工具是革命卫队。这是主要机构。但就合法性而言，它仍然基于79年的革命以及他们所代表的理念。所以神职人员仍然与革命卫队紧密结盟。但如果局势失控变得更糟，比如说哈梅内伊被暗杀，那么我认为真正的权力将转移到革命卫队手中。届时它将成为一个军事机构。</p>

            <div class="original-text">
                <p>You have written extensively about the Tudeh Party, the communist wing in Iran, particularly in the part of an era. The Tudeh Party actually allied with Khomeini only to be purged later. His question is, did the party have some viable alternative course of action? Was that alliance a fatal miscalculation or an unavoidable choice under the circumstances?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>您曾广泛地撰写过关于伊朗人民党（Tudeh Party），即伊朗的共产主义派别的文章，特别是在那个时代。人民党实际上与霍梅尼结盟，但后来却遭到了清洗。他的问题是，该党当时是否有其他可行的行动方案？那个联盟是一个致命的误判，还是在当时情况下一个不可避免的选择？</p>

        <div class="interview-block">
            <p class="speaker-name">厄尔凡德·阿布拉哈米安:</p>
            <div class="original-text">
                <p>I mean, it wasn't a problem just for the Tudeh Party. I think all secular and leftist parties, even the nationalists, once the revolution occurred, they expected somehow things would go back to 1953. You would have a nationalist movement, you'd have a socialist movement, a communist movement. What was surprising was, of course, the Islamic movement, how much it was based on his charisma, how much was based on actually deep-seated Shia faith is debatable. So all the organizations were confronted with how to deal with a political environment that was not basically open to secular, liberal, nationalist, socialist, or communist positions. Some took an intransigent opposition position right away and said this was a fascist organization and we will oppose it, and there was a crackdown. The Mojahedin, who were the religious radicals, tried an uprising and were crushed. So the Tudeh Party had a separate line, which was that we support the Islamic Republic of Khomeini as long as they are anti-imperialist. Even though they had a lot of qualms about the policies of the government, especially about women, about land reform, about property respect for property, and so on. Labor law was an issue. They had qualms about all those issues, but they said the overriding issue was imperialism.</p>
                <p>Where that broke down is interesting. It broke down, of course, once Iraq invaded Iran. The thinking was that Iran would collapse, but in fact, it caused the population to rally behind the regime to fight the Iraqis on a basically nationalistic protection. The Tudeh also supported very much the regime and the war. The change came, and this is often ignored in the analysis, the change came when Iran liberated the main city of Khorramshahr from Saddam Hussein. And then the decision was basically in front of the regime: do they end the war by accepting Saddam Hussein's peace offer, which was basically going back to before the war? It would have been a victory for Iran because Iran then had the frontiers it had before. And Khomeini, for reasons we don't know yet because they were never really opened up, decided that they would continue the war into Iraq. And so the war expanded into Iraq with the two slogans: "War until victory," and the other was, "The road to Jerusalem is through Baghdad." So it became an expansive war, an extension into an Iraqi war. So actually, of the eight years of war, six years were after Iran's invasion of Iraq. So when that decision was made, the Tudeh Party began to criticize the Islamic Republic. And their argument was that if you continue this war, this will give access for American imperialism to come back to the Middle East because they will then support Saddam Hussein. So they broke with the regime for the first time and openly criticized the regime on foreign policy. And that's when the crackdown came. And the Islamic Republic was shrewd enough, Machiavellian enough, not to actually crack down on the Tudeh on this ground, but on the grounds that they were spying for the Soviet Union. There was no secret the Tudeh Party was pro-Soviet. And it was open that every week an emissary from the Tudeh Party would go to the Soviet embassy with basically the memos from the chairman of the Communist Party to the chairman of the Soviet Communist Party, giving their views on what was happening in Iran. So, but this was all monitored. The regime had their own monitoring outside the embassy. They knew everyone who was coming in and out. That had been going on actually since the revolution, so it was nothing new. But they used this connection with the Soviets to claim that actually the Tudeh Party was a spy organization. But I would say the real reason was that they broke with the regime on an important issue. And this, of course, happened with any organization. Once they broke with the regime on an important issue, there was a crackdown. When the liberal Muslims like Bazargan, the former prime minister, broke his relations with the regime, they were automatically arrested as being spies of the CIA. So this was the basically discourse of the time.</p>
            </div>

                <p>我的意思是，这不仅仅是人民党的问题。我认为所有的世俗和左翼政党，甚至是民族主义者，在革命发生后，他们都期望情况能以某种方式回到1953年。你会有一个民族主义运动，一个社会主义运动，一个共产主义运动。令人惊讶的当然是伊斯兰运动，它在多大程度上是基于其领袖的个人魅力，又在多大程度上是基于根深蒂固的什叶派信仰，这一点是值得商榷的。所以所有的组织都面临着如何应对一个基本上不接受世俗、自由、民族主义、社会主义或共产主义立场的政治环境。一些组织立即采取了不妥协的反对立场，称这是一个法西斯组织，我们将反对它，然后就遭到了镇压。宗教激进分子“人民圣战者组织”（Mojahedin）试图发动起义，但被镇压了。所以人民党采取了另一条路线，即只要霍梅尼的伊斯兰共和国是反帝国主义的，我们就支持它。尽管他们对政府的许多政策，特别是关于妇女、土地改革、尊重财产权等问题有很多疑虑。劳动法也是一个问题。他们对所有这些问题都有疑虑，但他们说，最重要的问题是帝国主义。</p>
                <p>这个联盟的破裂之处很有趣。当然，它是在伊拉克入侵伊朗后破裂的。当时的想法是伊朗会崩溃，但事实上，这反而促使民众团结在政权周围，以一种基本上是民族主义的自卫来对抗伊拉克人。人民党也非常支持政权和战争。变化发生之时，这一点在分析中常常被忽略，是当伊朗从萨达姆·侯赛因手中解放了主要城市霍拉姆沙赫之后。然后，政权面临一个抉择：他们是接受萨达姆·侯赛因的和谈提议，基本上就是回到战前状态，来结束战争吗？那对伊朗来说本会是一场胜利，因为伊朗将恢复其原有的边界。而霍梅尼，出于我们至今仍不清楚的原因，因为相关档案从未真正公开，决定将战争继续打到伊拉克境内。于是，战争扩大到伊拉克，并伴随着两个口号：“战斗至胜利”，另一个是“通往耶路撒冷的道路经过巴格达”。所以它变成了一场扩张性的战争，延伸到伊拉克境内。实际上，在八年战争中，有六年的时间是在伊朗入侵伊拉克之后。所以，当那个决定做出后，人民党开始批评伊斯兰共和国。他们的论点是，如果你们继续这场战争，这将为美帝国主义重返中东提供机会，因为他们届时会支持萨达姆·侯赛因。于是，他们第一次与政权决裂，并公开在外交政策上批评政权。镇压就在那时发生了。而伊斯兰共和国足够精明，也足够马基雅维利，没有以此为由镇压人民党，而是以他们为苏联从事间谍活动的罪名。人民党亲苏不是什么秘密。而且，每周人民党的使者都会去苏联大使馆，带着共产党主席给苏联共产党主席的备忘录，陈述他们对伊朗局势的看法，这是公开的。但这一切都在被监视之中。政权在大使馆外有自己的监视。他们知道每一个进出的人。这实际上自革命以来就一直在进行，所以并非什么新鲜事。但他们利用这种与苏联的联系，来声称人民党实际上是一个间谍组织。但我会说，真正的原因是他们在重要问题上与政权决裂了。当然，任何组织都是如此。一旦他们在重要问题上与政权决裂，就会有镇压。当像前总理巴扎尔甘（Bazargan）这样的自由派穆斯林与政权断绝关系时，他们也立即被当作中情局的间谍逮捕。所以这基本上是那个时代的话语体系。</p>

                <p>So, I'm just curious about your perspective on Iran's nuclear bomb project. You know, there's a lot of media coverage, particularly recently, when Trump ordered the attack of the three nuclear facilities in Iran. And then they say, "Oh, Iranians are only weeks away from getting the nuclear bomb, maybe nine or 10 nuclear bombs, and then Israel may be wiped out by Iranian military force." Do you think that argument holds water? Do you think Iran is really pushing for a nuclear bomb?</p>
                <p>Why does the Iranian government not want to give up that power or that capability?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>所以我很好奇您对伊朗核弹项目的看法。最近有很多媒体报道，特别是当特朗普下令攻击伊朗的三个核设施时。他们说：“哦，伊朗人离拥有核弹只有几周之遥，可能会有九到十枚核弹，然后以色列可能会被伊朗的军事力量抹去。”您认为这个论点站得住脚吗？您认为伊朗真的在推动制造核弹吗？</p>
                <p>为什么伊朗政府不想放弃那种权力或能力？</p>

            <div class="original-text">
                <p>As long as there was monitoring under the Obama agreement, there was no way Iran could get near a nuclear bomb. So once that agreement was scrapped by Trump, Iran's position was then, "We can, we'll enrich to a higher level." I think it was more of a bargaining position, saying, "You know, come back to the agreement, otherwise we'll enrich more and more." But of course, by enriching more and more, you are getting closer to making, in theory, the position where you can make a bomb. So withdrawal from the agreement actually then started this process of escalation with the present situation now. They think that by bombing the facilities, they're going to solve the problem, but I don't think that's the case. If you think about it, as long as there's no regime change, they can rebuild those facilities. They can build it in the past; they have the technology, they have the capabilities. It just delayed that situation. And now, I think from Iran's perspective, they have more reason to get a nuclear bomb. Look at North Korea; they got a nuclear bomb, and America never goes to bomb them nowadays.</p>
                <p>Oh, it's actually somewhat here Mosaddegh is relevant. Nuclear technology is in Iran now considered a way of national honor, of being an important state, of being scientific, modern, and stuff. It's a way of declaring independence from the West. And Iran has actually quite a lot of, you can say, scientific knowledge. And it considers it in the way that before, oil nationalization was considered the hallmark of national independence. Now the view, whether right or wrong, is that to be an important, self-respecting nation, you have to have nuclear technology. That doesn't mean nuclear weapons, but nuclear technology. And that, for the Israelis, is actually potentially dangerous and unacceptable.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>只要奥巴马协议下的监督还在，伊朗就不可能接近拥有核弹。所以，一旦特朗普废除了那个协议，伊朗的立场就变成了：“我们可以，我们会进行更高水平的浓缩。”我认为这更像是一种谈判策略，意思是说：“你们回到协议上来，否则我们就会不断提高浓缩水平。”但当然，通过不断提高浓缩水平，理论上你确实离能够制造炸弹的位置越来越近了。所以，退出协议实际上开启了导致当前局势的升级过程。他们认为通过轰炸这些设施就能解决问题，但我认为事实并非如此。你想想看，只要政权不更迭，他们就能重建那些设施。他们过去能建，他们有技术，有能力。这只是推迟了那个情况。而现在，我认为从伊朗的角度来看，他们更有理由去获取核弹。看看朝鲜，他们拥有了核弹，现在美国就再也不去轰炸他们了。</p>
                <p>哦，实际上，在这一点上，摩萨德格的例子是有参考意义的。在当今的伊朗，核技术被认为是国家荣誉的象征，是成为一个重要国家、科学化、现代化等的标志。这是一种向西方宣告独立的方式。而且伊朗实际上拥有相当多的科学知识。它看待核技术的方式，就像以前看待石油国有化是国家独立标志一样。现在，无论对错，观点是，要成为一个重要的、有自尊的国家，你必须拥有核技术。这不一定意味着核武器，但必须有核技术。而这对于以色列人来说，实际上是潜在危险和不可接受的。</p>

                <p>I kind of see the parallel from the Mosaddegh era. The oil nationalization is seen as a national pride, and then inside the Iranian politics, if you're anti that, your political career may be over, right? The people may get angry at you, and it's very difficult for you to push for your agenda inside the government. Do you think that's an accurate description?</p>
                <p>What were the major successes and shortcomings of the 2015 JCPOA in your view?</p>

            <div class="original-text">
                <p>Yeah, also, I mean, I think even the critics of the Islamic Republic still wouldn't criticize the Islamic Republic for wanting peaceful nuclear technology. I think that agreement was actually a very good agreement. The criticism, once you look at it, doesn't hold water. The argument was that it's too vague, or you can't trust the Iranians, or there's a danger that they will cheat or basically secretly build a bomb. But actually, if you look at the details, it was a highly detailed agreement. Iran could enrich to 3.67%. This isn't vague. At that time, it was actually enriching beyond that; it was reduced to 3.67%. Anything extra, and it was a limited amount you could enrich, a limited quantity. Anything above that had to be exported, sold only to Russia. And also, there were international monitors at all the nuclear sites to make sure that this was implemented, that there was no cheating. So it was a very good agreement. If you were really worried about Iran going nuclear, this was a very good agreement because it accepted the main demand of Iran that it had the right to enrich for peaceful purposes. And 3.67% is no way you can weaponize it. So that was the agreement that there would be no crisis now. So people now argue, "Well, the crisis started when Iran started enriching beyond that." But Iran started enriching beyond that once Trump withdrew from the agreement.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>是的，而且我认为即使是伊斯兰共和国的批评者，也不会因为伊朗想要和平利用核技术而批评它。我认为那个协议（JCPOA）实际上是一个非常好的协议。那些批评，一旦你仔细研究，就会发现是站不住脚的。他们的论点是，协议太模糊了，或者你不能信任伊朗人，或者他们有作弊、秘密制造核弹的危险。但实际上，如果你看细节，那是一个非常详细的协议。伊朗可以将浓缩铀丰度提高到3.67%。这并不模糊。当时，它实际上的浓缩水平比这更高；协议将其降低到了3.67%。任何超出的部分，而且浓缩的数量是有限的，都必须出口，只能卖给俄罗斯。此外，在所有核设施都有国际监督员，以确保协议得到执行，没有作弊。所以这是一个非常好的协议。如果你真的担心伊朗发展核武器，这是一个非常好的协议，因为它接受了伊朗的主要要求，即它有权为和平目的进行浓缩。而3.67%的丰度是无论如何也无法武器化的。所以，有了那个协议，现在就不会有危机了。所以现在人们争辩说：“危机是在伊朗开始进行更高水平浓缩时开始的。”但伊朗是在特朗普退出协议之后，才开始进行更高水平浓缩的。</p>

        <h3>特朗普退出核协议及其后果</h3>

            <div class="original-text">
                <p>So what do you think are the key reasons behind President Trump's decision to withdraw from that nuclear deal?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>那么您认为特朗普总统决定退出那个核协议的关键原因是什么？</p>

            <div class="original-text">
                <p>To satisfy Israel. I mean, at that time also, he was very much wanting both Jewish votes and also Christian evangelical votes that are also allied to Israel. So it was, in a way, that political campaigning on that issue, which is clever because you get votes on that. You don't get votes by being nice to Iran. But the cost of that is what we have now. So the present crisis, people start, "Well, you know, there's a crisis because Iran is enriching so much," but Iran would not have gotten to this enrichment position if that agreement had held. There are some people being cynical about that deal, saying that Barack Obama is too naive, like Iran will never follow the deal, adhere to whatever they agreed, and they're going to build a bomb inside the ground of the mountain, and then America will not know, and then Iran will come out with all these nuclear bombs. Do you think that's a reasonable critique? No, no. It wasn't like Obama was taking the Iranians' word for their claims. There was a very robust verification system. There were international observers, including Americans in there, who were monitoring all the enrichment and where it went. So now, actually, we have a nightmare because we have no idea what's going to happen. We don't know where the enrichment is taking place, where the highly enriched uranium is. But under the agreement, it was verification, but not trust, but trust with verification, using Reagan's terminology. So this idea somehow, "Well, he was naive, he trusted the Iranians." He was, in fact, very rigid, and the agreement was very actually robust in monitoring what was going to happen.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>为了取悦以色列。我的意思是，在那个时候，他也非常希望获得犹太选民和同样与以色列结盟的福音派基督徒的选票。所以在某种程度上，那是在那个议题上的政治竞选活动，这很聪明，因为你能在那个问题上获得选票。对伊朗友好是得不到选票的。但其代价就是我们现在所面临的局面。所以，现在的危机，人们开始说：“嗯，之所以有危机，是因为伊朗的浓缩水平太高了，”但如果那个协议得以维持，伊朗根本不会达到这个浓缩水平。有些人对那个协议持愤世嫉俗的态度，说奥巴马太天真了，好像伊朗永远不会遵守协议，不会信守他们的承诺，他们会在山里的地下制造核弹，然后美国不会知道，然后伊朗就会带着所有这些核弹冒出来。您认为这是一个合理的批评吗？不，不。并非奥巴马只是相信伊朗人的说法。当时有一个非常健全的核查体系。有国际观察员，包括美国人在内，在监控所有的浓缩活动及其去向。所以现在，我们实际上陷入了一场噩梦，因为我们完全不知道会发生什么。我们不知道浓缩在哪里进行，高浓缩铀在哪里。但在协议下，那是核查，不是信任，而是用里根的术语来说，是“信任但核查”。所以那种“他很天真，他信任伊朗人”的说法，其实不然。他实际上非常严格，而且协议在监控未来走向方面非常健全。</p>

            <div class="original-text">
                <p>So how would you compare the ways each regime kind of instrumentalized the historical trauma to forge this national identity and consolidate power? And to what extent does this dance with genuine ideological conviction, or to what extent is it a pragmatic tool for just deflecting domestic tensions? I think you've probably seen that a lot as a historian. How do you balance your political inclination and historical objectivity? As a historian, you basically try to really provide a balanced view. How do you kind of fight your own bias or inclination inside your heart?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>那么，您如何比较每个政权利用历史创伤来塑造民族认同和巩固权力的方式？这种做法在多大程度上源于真诚的意识形态信念，又在多大程度上仅仅是转移国内矛盾的实用工具？我想作为一名历史学家，您可能经常看到这种情况。您是如何平衡自己的政治倾向和历史客观性的？作为一名历史学家，您基本上是试图提供一个平衡的观点。您是如何对抗自己内心的偏见或倾向的？</p>

            <div class="original-text">
                <p>I think it's a useful tool, and it works to a certain extent, but after a long time, people, I think, get wise that it's basically an instrumentalist, weaponizing argument to basically stifle any criticism. Often, historians are accused of either being leftist or rightist or having a political agenda. When you say that, that implies that the historian has actually distorted the facts or misinterpreted documents, even cooked up documents to fit their theory. That doesn't mean historians don't have their basically biases or their own perceptions. And the perceptions don't come in terms of basically how you juggle facts. It's what questions you raise to investigate. History is about questions. It's not about description. It's about asking questions and trying to get answers to a question. So if I ask a question, "Why did the coup occur in Iran in 1953?" Now, for some people, that itself is a leftist question. Because for rightists, there was no coup. There was a people's, Shah's, revolt against Mosaddegh. And for American conservatives, again, there was no coup. There was a counter-coup because the communists were about to take over. To save Iran, the US carried out a counter-coup. So usually, with any history, the question that is raised to start to answer the question, to focus on the question, you could say there is a bias there. So, you know, "Why are you asking that question?" So that itself, you can say, "Yeah, if I ask a question, 'Why was there a coup?' if you think that is a leftist question to ask, then yeah, I have to admit that I'm asking a leftist question."</p>
                <p>Well, I take seriously if I find information that contradicts what I'm saying. If I find a document from the CIA in August of 1953 saying, "Yes, the communists are prepared to take over the country," then obviously that doesn't fit into my schema, and I would have to then change my conclusions. But in the research I basically worked on, I was surprised, in fact, finding so much information that fit into my narrative that actually the coup had nothing to do with communism. It had much to do about control over oil.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="translated-text">
                <p>我认为这是一个有用的工具，在一定程度上是有效的，但时间长了，我想，人们会变得聪明，认识到这基本上是一种工具主义的、武器化的论点，其根本目的是扼杀任何批评。通常，历史学家被指责为左派或右派，或带有政治议程。当你这样说时，意味着历史学家实际上歪曲了事实，或曲解了文件，甚至伪造文件以迎合他们的理论。这并不意味着历史学家没有他们基本的偏见或他们自己的看法。而这些看法并不体现在你如何玩弄事实上。它体现在你提出什么问题去研究。历史是关于问题的。它不是关于描述。它是关于提出问题并试图为问题找到答案。所以，如果我问一个问题，“为什么1953年伊朗会发生政变？”现在，对一些人来说，这本身就是一个左派的问题。因为对右派来说，根本没有政变。那是人民的、沙阿的、反对摩萨德格的起义。而对美国保守派来说，同样，没有政变。那是一场反政变，因为共产党人正准备接管。为了拯救伊朗，美国进行了一场反政变。所以通常，对于任何历史，你提出的问题，为了开始回答问题，为了聚焦于问题，你可以说那里存在偏见。所以，你知道，“你为什么问那个问题？”所以，这本身，你可以说，“是的，如果我问一个问题，‘为什么会有一场政变？’如果你认为这是一个左派的问题，那么，是的，我必须承认我正在问一个左派的问题。”</p>
                <p>嗯，如果我发现与我所说相矛盾的信息，我会认真对待。如果我发现一份1953年8月来自中情局的文件说，“是的，共产党人准备接管国家”，那么显然这与我的框架不符，我将不得不改变我的结论。但在我基本上进行的研究中，我实际上很惊讶，我找到了如此多的信息，它们都符合我的叙述，即那次政变实际上与共产主义无关。它更多地与对石油的控制有关。</p>
