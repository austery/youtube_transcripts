        <h2>第二次世界大战 (World War II)</h2>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">In Volume One of the War in the West, your book series on World War II, you write, “The Second World War witnessed the deaths of more than 60 million people, from over 60 different countries. Entire cities were laid waste, national borders were redrawn, and many millions more people found themselves displaced. Over the past couple of decades, many of those living in the Middle East, or parts of Africa and the Balkans, Afghanistan, and even the United States, may feel justifiably that these troubled times have already proved the most traumatic in their recent past. Yet globally, the Second World War was and remains the single biggest catastrophe of modern history. In terms of human drama, it is unrivaled. No other war has affected so many lives, in such a large number of countries.” So what to you makes World War II the biggest catastrophe in human drama in modern history, and maybe from a historian perspective, the most fascinating subject to study?</p>
        <p class="chinese">在您关于二战的系列丛书《西部战争》第一卷中，您写道：“第二次世界大战见证了来自60多个国家的超过6000万人的死亡。整座城市被夷为平地，国界被重新划分，还有数以百万计的人流离失所。在过去的几十年里，许多生活在中东、非洲部分地区、巴尔干半岛、阿富汗，甚至美国的人们，可能会理所当然地认为，这些动荡的时期已经是他们近代史上最痛苦的经历。然而，从全球范围来看，第二次世界大战过去是，现在仍然是现代史上最大的单一灾难。就人类戏剧而言，它是无与伦比的。没有其他战争能影响如此多国家的如此多生命。”那么，对您而言，是什么让第二次世界大战成为现代史上最大的人类灾难和戏剧，也许从历史学家的角度看，又是什么让它成为最引人入胜的研究课题？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">The thing about World War II is, it really is truly global. It’s fought in deserts, it’s fought in the Arctic, it’s fought across oceans, it’s fought in the air, it’s in jungle, it’s in the hills, it is on the beaches, it’s also on the Russian steppe, and it’s also in Ukraine. So it’s that global nature of it. I mean, I’ve interviewed people who were away for four years. I remember talking to a tank man from Liverpool in England called Sam Bradshaw, and he went away for four years. And when he came home, he’d been twice wounded, he’d been very badly wounded in North Africa, and then, he was shot in the neck in Italy, eventually got home. And when he came home, his mother had turned gray. His little baby sister, who had been 13 when he left, was now a young woman. His old school had been destroyed by Luftwaffe bombs. He didn’t recognize the place. And do you know what he did? He joined up again, went back out of Europe, and was one of the first people in Belsen, so …</p>
        <p class="chinese">关于第二次世界大战，它的特点在于其真正的全球性。战争在沙漠、在北极、跨越海洋、在空中、在丛林、在山丘、在海滩上进行，也在俄罗斯大草原和乌克兰进行。所以是它的全球性特质。我曾采访过一些离家四年的人。我记得和一位来自英国利物浦的坦克兵萨姆·布拉德肖交谈，他离家四年。当他回家时，他已两次负伤，一次在北非受了重伤，然后在意大利颈部中弹，最终回到了家。当他回到家时，他母亲的头发已经花白。他离开时才13岁的小妹妹，现在已经是一位年轻女性。他的母校被德国空军的炸弹摧毁。他已经认不出这个地方了。你知道他做了什么吗？他再次入伍，回到了欧洲，并成为最早进入贝尔森集中营的人之一，所以……</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">What was his justification for that, for joining right back?</p>
        <p class="chinese">他再次入伍的理由是什么？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">He just felt completely disconnected to home. He felt that the Gulf of time, his experiences had separated him from all the normalities of life, and he felt that the normalities of the life that he had known, before he’d gone away to war, had just been severed, in a really kind of cruel way, that he didn’t really feel he was able to confront at that particular point. But he decided to rejoin, couldn’t go back to the Third Royal Tank Regiment, so he went back to a different unit. It went from, kind of the Italian campaign, to the European theater. Didn’t see so much action at the end, but a lot of British troops, if you were in a certain division at a certain time, you know, ended up passing very close to Belsen, and you suddenly realize, “Okay, this was the right thing to do. We did have to get rid of Nazism. We did have to do this, because this is the consequence. It’s not just the oppression, it’s not just the secret police. It’s not just the expansionism of Nazism.” It is also the Holocaust, which hadn’t been given its name at that point, but you’re witnessing this kind of untold cruelty. And I’ve always sort of, I think a lot about Sam. I mean, he’s no longer with us, but he was one of the first people that I interviewed, and I interviewed him at great length. And I know you like a long interview, Lex, and I totally, totally get that. Because when you have a long interview, you really start getting to the nuts and bolts of it. One of the frustrations, for me, when I’m looking at oral histories of Second World War vets is usually, they’re kind of, they’re put on YouTube, or they’re put on a museum website. They’re 30 minutes, an hour, if you’re lucky, and you’re just scratching the surface. You never really get to know it, and you feel that they’re just repeating kind of stuff they’ve read in books themselves after the war, and stuff. I always leave, kind of feeling frustrated that I haven’t had a chance to kind of grill them on the kind of stuff that I would grill them on, if I was put in front of them.</p>
        <p class="chinese">他只是觉得与家完全脱节了。他觉得时间的鸿沟，他的经历已经将他与所有正常的生活隔离开来，他觉得他参战前所知的正常生活，已经被一种非常残酷的方式切断了，他在那个特定时刻觉得自己无法面对。但他决定重新入伍，回不到第三皇家坦克团，所以他去了另一个单位。从意大利战役转到欧洲战场。最后没有参加太多战斗，但很多英国军队，如果你在某个特定时间的某个师，你知道，最终都经过了贝尔森附近，你突然意识到：“好吧，这是正确的决定。我们确实必须摆脱纳粹主义。我们确实必须这样做，因为这就是后果。这不仅仅是压迫，不仅仅是秘密警察，也不仅仅是纳粹主义的扩张主义。”这也是大屠杀，当时还没有这个名字，但你正在目睹这种难以言喻的残忍。我总是会，我想，经常想起萨姆。我的意思是，他已经不在了，但他是第一批我采访的人之一，而且我采访了他很长时间。我知道你喜欢长篇采访，莱克斯，我完全理解。因为当你进行长篇采访时，你才能真正深入到事物的核心。对我来说，当我看二战老兵的口述历史时，一个挫败感是，它们通常被放在YouTube或博物馆网站上。幸运的话，也就30分钟到一个小时，你只是触及了皮毛。你永远无法真正了解，你感觉他们只是在重复战后自己在书中读到的东西之类的。我总是带着一种挫败感离开，感觉我没有机会像如果我当面采访他们那样，就我关心的事情去追问他们。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">So tank man. What was maybe the most epic, the most intense, or the most interesting story that he told you?</p>
        <p class="chinese">那么，坦克兵。他告诉你的故事中，最史诗、最激烈或者最有趣的是什么？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Well, I do remember him telling me, funny enough, it’s not really about the conflict. I remember him telling me about the importance of letters, and there was this guy who, literally every few weeks, the post would arrive intermittently. There was no kind of regular post, so it was supposed to be regular, but it didn’t come around regularly. So you might suddenly, suddenly get a flurry of five, all in one day. But he said there was this guy in his tank, a member of a different tank troop. He was a good friend of his in the same squadron. You had British half squadrons for their armor, which is,Americans would have a company. But yeah, to go back to Sam, so Sam, there was this guy in his squadron, and he’d get his letters from his girlfriend, his wife, and he said, “It was like a soap opera.” He said, “We all just waited for his letters to come in, so we could find out whether his daughter had got to school or something, won the swimming contest, or whatever it was.” The sort of details of this day to day kind of banal life was just absolute catnip to these guys. They absolutely loved it. And then, the letter arrived, the Dear John letter saying, “Sorry, I’ve found someone else, and it’s over.” And his friend was just absolutely devastated. It was the only thing that was keeping him going, this sense of this sort of continuity of home, this sort of foundation of his life back at home. Sam said he could see he was in a really, really bad way, and he thought, “He’s going to do something stupid.” And he went up to him, and he said, “Look, I know it’s bad, and I know it’s terrible, and I know you’re absolutely devastated, but you’ve got your mates here, just don’t do anything silly. Maybe when it’s all over, you can patch things up or sort things out.” And he said, “You’ve got to understand it from her point of view. It’s a long way. You haven’t seen you for two years,” this kind of stuff, “so just don’t do anything rash.” And of course, the next engagement, two days later, he was killed. And he said it was just a kind of, he just knew that was going to happen. So it was a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. That’s something I’ve never forgotten, that story, and I just thought, “It’s about human drama, that’s the truth of it,” and how people react to this totally alien situation. For the most part, the Second World War is fought by ordinary everyday people doing extraordinary things. And I think that’s something that’s so fascinating. I think, instinctively, I’m quite slapdash, I think. So I think I would’ve bought it literally. I don’t think it would have ended well for me. I’m just a bit careless.</p>
        <p class="chinese">嗯，我确实记得他告诉我的，有趣的是，这并不真正关乎冲突。我记得他告诉我信件的重要性，有这么一个人，几乎每隔几周，邮件就会断断续续地到达。没有那种定期的邮政服务，所以本该是定期的，但并不定期。所以你可能会突然一天收到五封信。但他说，在他的坦克里有这么一个人，是另一个坦克部队的成员。他是他同一个中队的好朋友。英国的装甲部队有半中队，而美国人则是一个连。但回到萨姆的故事，萨姆中队里有这么一个人，他会收到他女朋友、他妻子的来信，他说：“那就像一部肥皂剧。”他说：“我们都等着他的信来，这样我们就能知道他女儿是不是上学了，或者赢了游泳比赛，或者别的什么。”这种日常琐事的细节对这些家伙来说简直是致命的诱惑。他们非常喜欢。然后，那封信来了，一封“分手信”（Dear John letter），信上说：“对不起，我找到了别人，我们结束了。”他的朋友简直崩溃了。那是唯一支撑他活下去的东西，那种家的延续感，那种他在家乡生活的根基。萨姆说他能看出他情况非常、非常糟糕，他想：“他会做傻事的。”他走上前去，对他说：“听着，我知道这很糟，我知道这很可怕，我知道你完全崩溃了，但你有你的伙伴在这里，别做傻事。也许等一切都结束了，你可以弥补或者解决问题。”他说：“你得从她的角度看问题。路途遥远，你们已经两年没见了，”诸如此类的话，“所以别做任何冲动的事。”当然，两天后的下一次交战，他阵亡了。他说，这就像，他就是知道会发生。所以这是一种自我实现的预言。我永远也忘不了那个故事，我只是想，“这就是人类的戏剧，这就是真相，”以及人们如何应对这种完全陌生的处境。在很大程度上，第二次世界大战是由普通人做着非凡的事情打的。我认为这非常迷人。我想，本能地，我相当马虎。所以我想我会信以为真。我不认为我的结局会好。我只是有点粗心。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Yeah, I think I also have an element in me, where I can believe in the idea of nation, and fight for a nation, especially when the conflict is as grand.</p>
        <p class="chinese">是的，我想我内心也有一种元素，我可以相信国家的理念，并为一个国家而战，尤其是在冲突如此宏大的时候。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">There are things worse than death. The Soviet Union was facing the prospect of being enslaved, literally. I mean, it was very, very clearly stated what they’re going to do. They’re going to repopulate the land with Germanic people, so … Well, they’re not just going to do that. They’re also going to starve lots and lots of Soviet individuals to death by the Hunger Plan, for example, which is planned really very casually, and not by the, this is not SS units or anything like this. This is the Wehrmacht, this is the economic division of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, the German combined general staff. General Georg Thomas comes up, and Hermann Backe, who’s the, kind of Minister for Food. They come up, “What are we going to do? We haven’t got enough food,” largely because German farming is inefficient, and they think, “Well, this is part of Lebensraum. We’ll go in and we’ll take the food.” And there’s been this colossal urbanization of the Soviet Union since the revolution in 1917. “So they’re just not going to get their food, these people in these cities because we’re going to take it all. And that’s going to lead to a lot of deaths.” “Umpteen millions” is the phrase that Georg Thomas used.</p>
        <p class="chinese">有些事比死亡更糟。苏联面临着被奴役的前景，字面意义上的。我的意思是，他们非常、非常清楚地说明了他们要做什么。他们要用日耳曼人重新填充这片土地，所以……嗯，他们不只是要这么做。他们还要通过“饥饿计划”（Hunger Plan）让大量苏联人饿死，例如，这个计划的制定非常随意，而且不是由党卫军部队或类似组织制定的。这是国防军（Wehrmacht），是德国联合总参谋部（Oberkommando der Wehrmacht）的经济部门。格奥尔格·托马斯将军和赫尔曼·巴克（Hermann Backe），也就是当时的粮食部长，他们提出：“我们该怎么办？我们没有足够的食物，”这主要是因为德国的农业效率低下，他们想：“嗯，这是‘生存空间’（Lebensraum）的一部分。我们会进去，我们会拿走食物。”自1917年革命以来，苏联经历了巨大的城市化。“所以，这些城市里的人们根本得不到食物，因为我们要把所有的食物都拿走。这将导致大量死亡。”“无数百万”是格奥尔格·托马斯使用的措辞。</p>

        <h2>生存空间与希特勒的意识形态 (Lebensraum and Hitler ideology)</h2>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">So let’s talk about the Hunger Plan. How important was the Hunger Plan and Lebensraum to Nazi ideology, and to the whole Nazi war machine?</p>
        <p class="chinese">那么，我们来谈谈“饥饿计划”。“饥饿计划”和“生存空间”（Lebensraum）对纳粹意识形态以及整个纳粹战争机器有多重要？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Essential to the whole thing. This is all about this notion that is embedded into Hitler’s mind, and into the minds of the Nazi party, right from the word go is, there is a big sort of global conspiracy, the Jewish Bolshevik plot, I mean, completely misplaced, that Jews and Bolsheviks go hand in hand, and that somehow dovetail. They don’t, obviously. And the whole ideology is to crush this. Part of the way the Nazis think, the way Hitler thinks is there is a them, and there’s us. We are the whites, Northern European Aryans, we should be the master race. We’ve been threatened by a global Jewish Bolshevik plot. We’ve been stabbed in the back in 1918, at the end of the first World War. We need to have to overcome, this is an existential battle for future survival. It’s a terrible task that has befallen our generation, but we have to do this, we have to overcome this or else we have no future. We will be crushed. It’s absolutely cut and dry. And one of the things about Hitler is that he is a very kind of black and white, them or us, either/or, kind of person. It’s always one thing or the other. It’s a thousand-year Reich, or it’s Armageddon. There is no, there’s no middle ground, there’s no gray area. It’s just one or the other. And that’s how, that’s his worldview. And the reason he came to the fore was because of the crystal clear clarity of his message, which is, “We’ve been stabbed in the back. There is a global plot. We have to overcome this. We are naturally the master race. We have to reassert ourselves. We have to get rid of global Jewry, we have to get rid of global Bolshevism, and we have to prevail, or else. But if we do prevail, oh, what an amazing world it’s going to be.” So he starts with this. Every speech he does, always starts with the same way, always starts from a kind of negative, and always ends with an incredible, positive, this sort of rabble-rousing crescendo of, if you’re in the front row, spittle, halitosis and gesticulation. I mean, you’ve seen pictures of him. I mean, I don’t know if you’ve ever seen pictures of him. He’s almost, he wants to grab the air and clutch it to him. You can see the venom coming out of his mouth, just in a single still photograph. I mean, it’s amazing. There’s apps you can get now, where you can translate his speeches, and it just sounds, by today’s standards, you would just think, “What a load of absolute wibble,” I mean, just total nonsense. But you have to put yourself back in the shoes of people listening to him in 1922 or ’23, or indeed, 1933, and see how kind of captivating that is to a certain part of the population. So, yeah, to go back to your original point, Lebensraum is absolutely part of it. So what you do is you crush the Bolsheviks, you crush world Jewry, then you expand. Britain has had this incredible empire, global empire. Germany needs that, too. Germany’s stuck in Europe, it doesn’t have access to the world’s oceans. So we’re not going to be a maritime empire. We’re going to be a landmass empire, the whole of landmass of Europe, and into Asia, that’s going to be us. We’re going to take that land, we’re going to take the breadbasket of Ukraine, we’re going to use that for our own ends. We’re going to make ourselves rich, but we’re also going to spread our peoples. We’re going to spread the Aryan Northern Master race throughout Europe, and into the traditional Slavic areas, and we will prevail, and come out on top. And so, you have to understand that everything about Operation Barbarossa, the planned invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, is totally wrapped up in the Nazi ideology. And people, I’ve read it, that historians will go, “If only Hitler had realized that the Ukrainians have been quite happy to kind of fight on his side, if only he’d actually brought some of these Jewish scientists into the Nazi fold, then Germany might have prevailed in World War II.” And you kind of think, “Well, you’re missing the entire point. That’s just never going to happen, because this is an ideological war.”</p>
        <p class="chinese">对整个事情至关重要。这一切都源于一个根深蒂固于希特勒和纳粹党心中的观念，从一开始就是：存在一个巨大的全球阴谋，即“犹太布尔什维克阴谋”，我的意思是，这完全是错误的，认为犹太人和布尔什维克是同流合污的，并且以某种方式契合。显然，他们不是。整个意识形态就是要粉碎这个。纳粹和希特勒思考方式的一部分是，有“他们”，也有“我们”。我们是白人，北欧雅利安人，我们应该是优等民族。我们受到了全球犹太布尔什维克阴谋的威胁。我们在1918年第一次世界大战结束时被背后捅了一刀。我们必须克服，这是一场关乎未来生存的存亡之战。这是一个降临在我们这一代人身上的可怕任务，但我们必须这样做，我们必须克服这个，否则我们就没有未来。我们会被粉碎。这绝对是黑白分明的。希特勒的一个特点是，他是一个非常黑白分明、非此即彼、要么/要么的人。总是一件事或另一件事。要么是千年帝国，要么是世界末日。没有中间地带，没有灰色区域。只有一种或另一种。这就是他的世界观。他之所以能脱颖而出，是因为他信息的清晰明了：“我们被背后捅了刀。有一个全球阴谋。我们必须克服这个。我们天生就是优等民族。我们必须重振旗鼓。我们必须铲除全球的犹太人，我们必须铲除全球的布尔什维克主义，我们必须胜利，否则。但如果我们真的胜利了，哦，那将是一个多么美好的世界。”所以他从这里开始。他的每一次演讲，总是以同样的方式开始，总是从一种消极的方面开始，然后以一种不可思议的、积极的、煽动性的高潮结束，如果你坐在前排，会看到唾沫、口臭和手势。我的意思是，你看过他的照片。我不知道你是否看过他的照片。他几乎是，他想抓住空气，把它紧紧地抱在怀里。你甚至可以从一张静态照片中看到他口中喷出的毒液。我的意思是，这很惊人。现在有一些应用程序，你可以翻译他的演讲，按今天的标准听起来，你只会觉得，“这完全是胡说八道，”我的意思是，完全是废话。但你必须设身处地地回到1922年或23年，甚至是1933年，听他演讲的人们的角度，看看这对一部分人来说是多么迷人。所以，是的，回到你最初的观点，“生存空间”（Lebensraum）绝对是其中的一部分。所以你所做的是，你粉碎布尔什维克，你粉碎世界上的犹太人，然后你扩张。英国拥有这个不可思议的全球帝国。德国也需要这个。德国被困在欧洲，它无法进入世界海洋。所以我们不会成为一个海洋帝国。我们将成为一个陆地帝国，整个欧洲大陆，直到亚洲，都将是我们的。我们将占领那片土地，我们将占领乌克兰的粮仓，我们将用它来实现我们自己的目的。我们将使自己变得富有，但我们也将传播我们的人民。我们将在整个欧洲，以及传统的斯拉夫地区，传播雅利安北欧优等民族，我们将胜利，并最终脱颖而出。所以，你必须明白，关于1941年6月计划入侵苏联的“巴巴罗萨行动”（Operation Barbarossa）的一切，都完全包裹在纳粹意识形态之中。有人，我读过，历史学家会说，“要是希特勒意识到乌克兰人很乐意站在他这边战斗就好了，要是他真的把一些犹太科学家拉入纳粹阵营，那么德国可能就在第二次世界大战中获胜了。”你会觉得，“嗯，你完全没抓住重点。那永远不会发生，因为这是一场意识形态的战争。”</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Yeah, this is not a pragmatic rational leader.</p>
        <p class="chinese">是的，这不是一个务实理性的领导人。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">No. I mean part of his effectiveness, we should say, is probably the singular belief in this ideology. There’s pros and cons. For an effective military machine, probably having that singular focus is effective. Yes, except that when you’re making military decisions, if those decisions are always being bracketed by an ideology, which is fundamentally flawed, from a pragmatic point of view, as much as a kind of reasonable point of view, you’re opening yourselves up for trouble. I mean, this is a problem he has with Barbarossa. They realize very early on, in 1941, when they’re war gaming this whole operation, that it’s not going to work. So there’s people like General Paulus, who’s on the staff at the time. He’s in charge of war gaming this, and he goes, “This isn’t going to work.” And Keitel, who is the chief of the OKW, goes, “No, no, no, no, no. Go back and make it work.” He goes, “Okay.” So he comes back with a plan that does work, but it’s bogus. I mean, it doesn’t work, because they don’t have. They don’t have enough motorization. They go into Barbarossa with 2,000 different types of vehicle. Every single one of those vehicles has to have different distributor caps, and different leads, and plugs, and all sorts of different parts. The interoperability of the German mechanized arm is super inefficient. So you’ve got huge problems, because they kind of think, “Well, we took France in 1940, and that’s one of the most modern countries in the world, with one of the greatest armies and armed forces in the world, and we did that in six weeks.” So, Soviet Union, look, they struggled against Finland, for goodness sake. I mean, how hard can it be? But what you’re failing to understand is that attacking the Soviet Union is over a geographical landmass 10 times the size of France, just on the frontage. And you haven’t really got much more mechanization than you had in May 1940, when they attacked the Low Countries and France. And you’ve actually got less Luftwaffe aircraft to support you, and you just do not have the operational mechanics to make it work successfully. I mean, it is largely down to incompetence of the Red Army and the Soviet leadership in the summer of 1941 that they get as far as they do. I mean, Barbarossa should never have come close to being a victory.</p>
        <p class="chinese">不。我的意思是，我们应该说，他的一部分效力可能在于他对这种意识形态的单一信仰。这有其利弊。对于一个高效的军事机器来说，拥有那种单一的焦点可能是有效的。是的，除非当你做出的军事决策总是被一种从务实角度看，就像从理性角度看一样，存在根本缺陷的意识形态所束缚时，你就是在自找麻烦。我的意思是，这是他在“巴巴罗萨行动”（Barbarossa）中遇到的问题。他们在1941年很早就意识到，当他们对整个行动进行兵棋推演时，它行不通。所以，像当时在参谋部的保卢斯（Paulus）将军。他负责这次兵棋推演，他说：“这行不通。”而OKW（国防军最高统帅部）的负责人凯特尔（Keitel）说：“不，不，不，不，不。回去让它行得通。”他说：“好吧。”所以他回来时拿出了一个可行的计划，但那是假的。我的意思是，它行不通，因为他们没有。他们没有足够的摩托化。他们用2000种不同类型的车辆进入巴巴罗萨行动。每一种车辆都需要不同的分电器盖、不同的导线、插头和各种不同的零件。德国机械化部队的互操作性非常低效。所以你面临着巨大的问题，因为他们会想：“嗯，我们在1940年占领了法国，那是世界上最现代化的国家之一，拥有世界上最强大的军队和武装力量之一，我们只用了六周就做到了。”所以，苏联，看，他们连芬兰都打得那么费劲。我的意思是，能有多难呢？但你没能理解的是，攻击苏联是在一个地理面积是法国10倍的陆地上，仅仅是前线。而且你的机械化程度并没有比1940年5月攻击低地国家和法国时高多少。而且你实际上支持你的德国空军飞机更少了，你根本没有能使其成功运作的作战机制。我的意思是，他们在1941年夏天能走那么远，很大程度上要归咎于红军和苏联领导层的无能。我的意思是，巴巴罗萨行动根本就不应该接近胜利。</p>

        <h2>巴巴罗萨行动 (Operation Barbarossa)</h2>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Let’s talk through it. So, Operation Barbarossa that you’re mentioning, and we’ll go back to ’39 and ’40, straight into it. So this is June 1941, Operation Barbarossa, when Hitler invades the Soviet Union with, I think, the largest invading force in history, up to that point. And there’s three prongs, Army Group North, Army Group Center, Army Group South. North is going to Leningrad. Center is going, it’s the strongest group, directly towards Moscow, and South is going and targeting Ukraine and the Caucasus. So, can you linger on that on the details of this plan? What was the thinking? What was the strategy? What was the tactics? What was the logistics? There’s so many things to say, but one of them is to say that you often emphasize the importance of three ways to analyze military conflict, of the strategic, the operational and tactical. And the operational is often not given enough time attention, and it’s the logistics that make the war machine really work successfully, or fail.</p>
        <p class="chinese">我们来谈谈吧。你提到的巴巴罗萨行动，我们会回到39年和40年，直接切入。这是1941年6月的巴巴罗萨行动，当时希特勒以我认为是历史上截至那时为止最大规模的入侵部队，入侵了苏联。行动有三个主攻方向，北方集团军群、中央集团军群和南方集团军群。北方集团军群的目标是列宁格勒。中央集团军群是实力最强的，直指莫斯科。南方集团军群则以乌克兰和高加索地区为目标。所以，你能否就这个计划的细节多谈谈？当时的思路是什么？战略是什么？战术是什么？后勤又是怎样的？有很多可以说的，但其中一点是，你经常强调分析军事冲突的三个层面：战略、战役和战术。而战役层面往往没有得到足够的重视，但正是后勤决定了战争机器的成败。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Yeah, that’s absolutely spot-on. And it’s interesting, because the vast majority of general histories of World War II tend to focus on the strategic and the tactical. So what do I mean by that? Well, the strategic, just for those who don’t know, that’s your overall war aims, get to Moscow, whatever it might be, conquer the world. That’s your strategy. The tactical side of things is, that’s the coalface of war. That’s the attritional bit. That’s the following in his Spitfire, the tank crew, the soldier in his foxhole, it’s the actual kinetic fighting bit. The operational bit is the level of war that links the strategic to the tactical. So it is absolutely factories, it’s economics, it’s shipping, it’s supply chains, it’s how you manage your war. And one of the things where I think people have been guilty in the past, historians have been guilty in the past, is by judging warfare all on the same level. But obviously, every competent nation has a different approach to war, because of the nation they are, the size they are, their geographical location. But America’s coming at it from a different perspective, Britain’s coming apart, from a different perspective. Britain’s empire is all about, it’s a shipping, it’s a seaborne empire. Whereas, there’s also another point, which is having large armies is actually inherently impractical and inefficient, because the larger the army, the more people you’ve got to feed, the more barracks you’ve got to have, the more space you’ve got to have for training, the more people you’re taking out of your workforce to produce tanks and shells, and all the rest of it, because they’re tramping around with rifles. So there’s an argument saying, actually, it’s really not a very good way of doing things. So very much, the British way, and subsequently, the United States way, and the way of Britain’s dominions and empire, is to use steel, not our flesh, as a principle. Because the idea is that you use technology, mechanization, modernity, global reach, to do a lot of your hard yards. That’s the basic principle behind the strategic air campaign. When we talk about the strategic air campaign, we’re talking about strategic air forces which are operating in isolation from other armed forces. So a tactical air force, for example, is an Air force which is offering close air support for ground operations. A strategic air force has got nothing to do with ground operations, it’s just operating on its own. So that’s your bomber force, or whatever, that’s your B-17s and B 24s of the Eighth Air Force, flying out of East England, bombing the industrial complex of Germany, or whatever it might be. So it’s important to understand that when you compare, you have to have in the back of your mind that Britain, compared to Germany, for example, is coming at it from a completely different perspective. And I would say one of the failures of Hitler is that he always views everybody through his own very narrow worldview, which is not particularly helpful. You want to get inside the head of your enemy, and he’s sort of guilty of not doing that. So when you’re talking about Operation Barbarossa, to go back to your original question, Lex, you’re dealing with an operation on such a vast scale, that that operational level of war is absolutely vital to its chances of success or failure. It doesn’t matter how good your individual commanders are at the front. If you haven’t got the backup, it’s not going to work. And the problem that the Germans have is yes, they’ve got their three million men on the front, and they’ve got their kind of 3,000 aircraft, and all the rest of it. But actually, what you need to do is break it down. And who is doing the hard yards of that? The way that the German war machine works is that the machine bit is only the spearhead. So people always talk about the Nazi war machine. In a way, it’s a kind of misnomer, because you’re sort of suggesting that it’s highly mechanized and industrialized, and all the rest of it. And nothing could be further from the truth. The spearhead is, but the rest of it is not. And this is the fatal flaw of the German armed forces in the whole of World War II, really, but even in this early stage, because in Barbarossa, you’re talking about 17 Panzer divisions out of the 100-odd that are involved in the initial attack. Well, 17, a Panzer division is not a division full of Panzers, tanks. It is a combined arms motorized outfit. So, scouts on BMWs with sidecars, armored cars, infantry grenadiers, Panzer grenadiers, which are infantry in half tracks and trucks, mechanized. It is motorized artillery. It is motorized anti-aircraft artillery. It is motorized anti-tank artillery. Of course, it is tanks as well, Panzers. But those are a really, really small proportion of, you’re talking, less than 20% of your attacking force are those spearhead forces. And inevitably, they are going to be attrited as they go. You are going to take casualties. Not only that, you’re not going to just take battlefield casualties, you’re also going to have mechanical casualties, because of the huge spaces involved. You just simply can’t function. So what you see is, in the initial phases of Operation Barbarossa, they surge forward. Red Army’s got absolutely no answers to anything. Stalin, weirdly, hasn’t heeded all the warnings that this attack is brewing. And there have been plenty, incidentally. And Smolensk falls on the 15th of July, in just less than four weeks. It’s just incredible. Three and a half weeks, Smolensk has gone, they’ve done, overwhelmed the rest of what had been Poland. They’ve surged into what is now Belarus, taken Smolensk. This is Army Group Center. Army Group North thrust up into the Baltic. It’s all going swimmingly well. But then, the next several months, they barely go a hundred miles, and that’s because they’re running out of steam. The 16th Panzer division, for example, by the time it’s taken Smolensk, involved in taking Smolensk on the 15th of July, 1941, the following day, it’s got 16 tanks left, 16 out of should have 180. So it’s just being attrited. They can’t sustain it, and they can’t sustain it, because as the Russians fall back, as the Soviet Red Army falls back, they do their own scorched earth policy. They also discover that the railway line is kind of a different loading gauge, so they’ve got to change it. So it’s slightly, the Russian loading gauge is slightly wider. So every single mile, every yard, every foot, every meter of the capturing of Russian railway has to be moved a couple of inches to the left, to make it fit the German Kriegslok, in the standard train of locomotive, of the Reichsbahn. Just imagine what that’s like. And also, Soviet trains are bigger, so they can take more water, which means, the water stops in between are fewer and far between. So they have to, the Germans, when they come in, their trains, their Kriegsloks are smaller. So they have to be re-watered more often, and re-coaled more often. I mean, it’s absolutely boggling just how complicated it is, and how badly planned it is, because they haven’t reckoned on this. They’re having to kind of think on their feet.</p>
        <p class="chinese">是的，完全正确。这很有趣，因为绝大多数关于二战的通史都倾向于关注战略和战术层面。那么，我是什么意思呢？嗯，战略，对于那些不知道的人来说，就是你的总体战争目标，比如攻占莫斯科，或者征服世界。这就是你的战略。战术层面，则是战争的前线，是消耗战的部分。是驾驶喷火战斗机的飞行员，是坦克乘员，是散兵坑里的士兵，是实际的动能战斗部分。而战役层面，则是连接战略与战术的战争层面。所以它绝对是工厂、经济、航运、供应链，是你如何管理你的战争。我认为过去人们，过去的历史学家，犯的一个错误就是用同一个标准来评判所有战争。但显然，每个有能力的国家都有不同的战争方式，这取决于他们是哪个国家、他们的规模、他们的地理位置。但美国是从不同的角度来看待的，英国也是从不同的角度来看待的。大英帝国的一切都与航运有关，它是一个海洋帝国。然而，还有另一点，那就是拥有庞大的军队实际上本质上是不切实际和低效的，因为军队越大，你需要养活的人就越多，你需要的兵营就越多，你需要的训练空间就越多，你从劳动力中抽调出来生产坦克、炮弹等等的人就越多，因为他们在用步枪到处奔波。所以有一种观点认为，实际上，这不是一个很好的做事方式。因此，英国的方式，以及后来的美国的方式，以及英国自治领和帝国的方式，其原则是使用钢铁，而不是我们的血肉。因为其理念是，你使用技术、机械化、现代化、全球覆盖来完成大量艰苦的工作。这是战略空袭背后的基本原则。当我们谈论战略空袭时，我们谈论的是独立于其他武装力量运作的战略空军。所以，一个战术空军，例如，是为地面行动提供近距离空中支援的空军。一个战略空军与地面行动无关，它只是独立运作。所以那是你的轰炸机部队，或者别的什么，那是第八航空队的B-17和B-24，从英格兰东部起飞，轰炸德国的工业综合体，或者别的什么。所以重要的是要明白，当你比较时，你必须在脑海里记住，英国，与德国相比，例如，是从一个完全不同的角度来看待的。我会说，希特勒的一个失败之处在于，他总是通过自己非常狭隘的世界观来看待每个人，这并不是特别有帮助。你想进入你敌人的头脑，而他有点没有做到这一点。所以当你谈论巴巴罗萨行动时，回到你最初的问题，莱克斯，你正在处理一个规模如此巨大的行动，以至于那个战役层面的战争对其成败至关重要。你前线的个别指挥官有多优秀并不重要。如果你没有后援，它就不会成功。德国人面临的问题是，是的，他们前线有三百万士兵，他们有大约三千架飞机，等等。但实际上，你需要做的是将其分解。谁在做那件苦差事？德国战争机器的运作方式是，机器部分只是矛头。所以人们总是谈论纳粹战争机器。在某种程度上，这是一个用词不当，因为你好像在暗示它是高度机械化和工业化的，等等。而事实恰恰相反。矛头是，但其余部分不是。这是整个二战中德国武装力量的致命缺陷，真的，但即使在早期阶段也是如此，因为在巴巴罗萨行动中，你谈论的是在最初攻击中涉及的100多个师中有17个装甲师。嗯，17个，一个装甲师不是一个充满装甲车、坦克的师。它是一个摩托化的合成兵种部队。所以，有骑着宝马带边车的侦察兵、装甲车、步兵掷弹兵、装甲掷弹兵，也就是乘坐半履带车和卡车的机械化步兵。它是摩托化炮兵。它是摩托化高射炮。它是摩托化反坦克炮。当然，它也有坦克，装甲车。但那些只是非常、非常小的一部分，你谈论的是，不到20%的攻击部队是那些矛头部队。不可避免地，它们会在前进中被消耗。你会遭受伤亡。不仅如此，你不仅会遭受战场伤亡，你还会因为巨大的空间而遭受机械故障。你根本无法运作。所以你看到的是，在巴巴罗萨行动的初始阶段，他们向前猛冲。红军对任何事情都束手无策。奇怪的是，斯大林没有理会所有关于这次攻击正在酝酿的警告。顺便说一下，警告有很多。斯摩棱斯克在7月15日陷落，只用了不到四周时间。这简直不可思议。三个半星期，斯摩棱斯克就没了，他们完成了，压倒了曾经是波兰的其余部分。他们冲进了现在的白俄罗斯，占领了斯摩棱斯克。这是中央集团军群。北方集团军群向波罗的海推进。一切都进行得很顺利。但接下来的几个月，他们几乎没有前进一百英里，那是因为他们后劲不足。例如，第16装甲师，到1941年7月15日占领斯摩棱斯克时，第二天，它只剩下16辆坦克，而本该有180辆。所以它只是被消耗掉了。他们无法维持，他们无法维持，因为当俄国人撤退时，当苏联红军撤退时，他们实行了自己的焦土政策。他们还发现铁路线的轨距不同，所以他们必须改变它。所以它稍微，俄国的轨距稍微宽一些。所以每一英里、每一码、每一英尺、每一米的俄国铁路的占领，都必须向左移动几英寸，以适应德国的战争机车（Kriegslok），也就是德国国营铁路（Reichsbahn）的标准机车。想象一下那是什么样子。而且，苏联的火车更大，所以它们可以装更多的水，这意味着，中间的加水站更少、更远。所以他们必须，德国人，当他们进来时，他们的火车，他们的战争机车更小。所以它们必须更频繁地加水，更频繁地加煤。我的意思是，这简直令人难以置信，它是多么复杂，又是多么计划不周，因为他们没有考虑到这一点。他们不得不随机应变。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">I love the logistical details of all of this, because yes, that’s a huge component of this, especially when you’re covering that much territory. But there is a notion that if Hitler didn’t stop Army Group Center, it could have pushed all the way to Moscow. It was only maybe a hundred miles away from Moscow. Is that a possibility? Because it had so much success in the early days, pushing forward. Do you think it’s possible that if Hitler, as we mentioned from a military blunder perspective, didn’t make that blunder, that they could have defeated the Soviet Union, right there and then?</p>
        <p class="chinese">我喜欢所有这些后勤细节，因为是的，这是其中一个巨大的组成部分，特别是当你覆盖那么多领土时。但有一种说法是，如果希特勒没有阻止中央集团军群，它本可以一直推进到莫斯科。它当时离莫斯科可能只有一百英里。这有可能吗？因为它在早期取得了如此大的成功，不断推进。你认为，如果我们之前提到的，从军事失误的角度来看，如果希特勒没有犯那个错误，他们是否有可能就在那时那地击败苏联？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Well, my own view is that they should never have got close. The Red Army has plenty of men to be able to see off anything that the Germans can do. The capture of Kyiv, for example, in September 1941, was a catastrophe for the Soviet Union, and should never have happened. I mean, Zhukov is saying to Stalin, ” We’ve got to pull back across the Dnieper.” So I was going, “No, you can’t possibly do that. You can’t abandon Kyiv. It’s the third city in the Soviet Union. You just can’t, no way. No, absolutely not.” And he goes, “Well, we are just going to be overwhelmed, we can’t hold this.” And he says, “Either back me or fire me, back me or sack me.” So Stalin sacks him. Obviously, as we know, Zhukov gets rehabilitated in pretty quick order, and Stalin does learn very quickly, thereafter, to learn the lessons. But the opening phase of Barbarossa has been a catastrophe. As a consequence of Stalin refusing to let his men retreat back across the Dnieper, which is a substantial barrier, and would be very difficult for the Germans to overwhelm, had they moved back in time, that’s another kind of 700,000 men put in the bag. I mean, that’s just staggering numbers. But yeah, I mean, there’s so many things wrong with the Barbarossa plan, too much of it. It’s just such a vast area. I mean, you’re talking about, kind of, 2,500 miles or something, of frontage. Maybe if you put your Panzer groups, which are these spearheads, and you put them all in one big thrust, and just go hell for leather, straight across, on a much more narrow front of, let’s say, 400 miles, rather than 1,200, then they might have just sort of burnt away straight through to Moscow.</p>
        <p class="chinese">嗯，我个人的看法是，他们根本就不应该接近。红军有足够的人力来抵御德国人所能做的一切。例如，1941年9月基辅的陷落，对苏联来说是一场灾难，本不应该发生。我的意思是，朱可夫对斯大林说：“我们必须撤退到第聂伯河对岸。”而斯大林说：“不，你绝对不能那么做。你不能放弃基辅。它是苏联的第三大城市。你就是不能，绝对不行。绝对不行。”而他说：“嗯，我们快要被淹没了，我们守不住了。”他说：“要么支持我，要么解雇我，支持我或解雇我。”所以斯大林解雇了他。显然，我们知道，朱可夫很快就官复原职，斯大林此后也很快吸取了教训。但巴巴罗萨行动的初期阶段是一场灾难。由于斯大林拒绝让他的部队撤退到第聂伯河对岸——那是一道重要的屏障，如果他们及时撤退，德国人将很难逾越——结果又是大约70万士兵被包围。我的意思是，那真是惊人的数字。但是，是的，我的意思是，巴巴罗萨计划有很多问题，太多了。那片区域太大了。我的意思是，你谈论的是大约2500英里的前线。也许如果你把你的装甲集群，也就是这些矛头，集中在一个大的突击中，然后全力以赴，直插过去，在一个更窄的前线，比如说400英里而不是1200英里，那么他们可能就能一路烧到莫斯科。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">They really caught the Red Army unprepared.</p>
        <p class="chinese">他们确实让红军措手不及。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Yeah.</p>
        <p class="chinese">是的。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Is there something to be said about the strategic genius of that, or was it just luck?</p>
        <p class="chinese">这其中是否有战略天才的成分，还是仅仅是运气？</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">So before that, would it be fair to say it was one of, if not the greatest army in the world?</p>
        <p class="chinese">那么，在此之前，说它是世界上最强大的军队之一，甚至是最强大的军队，公平吗？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Well, there was a lot of experience. There’s a lot of experience there, that’s for sure. And they’re the first people to adapt, create airborne troops, for example. So yes, I think there is an argument to say that, but the decapitation is absolutely brutal. If you’ve decapitated an army, you’ve then got to put new guys in charge. And someone who looks, on paper, like a half decent peacetime commander might not be a very good wartime commander. They’re different disciplines and different skills, and you don’t know that until you’re tested. It’s very hard to kind of judge. And of course, Stalin is existing in a vacuum of paranoia and suspicion all the time, which is unhelpful, when you’re trying to develop a strong armed forces. So they go into Finland, in back end of 1939, and they get really badly hammered. They do take about 50, they get the Karelia Peninsula, and they do take some ground, but at huge cost. I mean, the casualties are five times as bad as those of the Finns, and it’s a humiliation. So Hitler sees that, and thinks, “Oh, okay, they’re not up to much cop.” Then Hitler loses the Battle of Britain, and he thinks, “I can’t afford to fight a war on two fronts.” That’s one of the reasons why Germany loses the war in 1914 to ’18, is fighting on the Eastern front, but also fighting on the Western front at the same time. “We’ve got to avoid that, but I’ve got to get rid of Britain. And Britain hasn’t come out of the fight. Britain is still fighting in the backend of 1940, having won the Battle of Britain. And so, maybe I’ll go into the Soviet Union now, while the Red Army is still weak. We’re not 100% ready ourselves, but let’s hurry the whole thing forward.” Because originally, he’d been thinking of planning an operation in 1943 or 1944. So the idea is, you take Poland out, you take out France and the Low Countries, you conquer most of Western Europe, you knock out Britain, so therefore, you don’t have to worry so much about the United States, because they’re over on the other side of the Atlantic. That then gives him, buys him the time, to kind of rebuild up his strength for the all-out thrust on the Soviet Union. The failure to subdue Britain in 1940 changes all those plans and makes him think, “Actually, I’m going to go in early.” And he’s also been kind of, he’s hoisted by his own petard, because he starts to believe his own genius. Everyone told him that he wouldn’t be able to beat France and the Low Countries. Everyone told him that it wouldn’t work out when he went into Poland, everyone was really nervous about it. “Well, go hang you, cautious, awful aristocratic Prussian generals. I’m the best at this. I’ve told you, I’ve shown you. I’m the genius. I can do it.” He starts to believe his own hype. And of course, this is a problem. He’s surrounded by sycophants, and people who are constantly telling him that he’s this incredible genius. So he starts to believe it, and he thinks everything is possible. And he’s very much into this idea of the will of the German people, “This is our destiny, and I have a will.” As I say earlier on, it’s the thousand-year Reich, or Armageddon, “but momentum is with us, and we need to strike it, and only by gambling, only by being bold will the Germans prevail,” and all this kind of nonsense. And so that’s why he goes into Soviet Union in June 1941, rather than a couple of, or even three years later.</p>
        <p class="chinese">嗯，经验很丰富。那里的经验确实很丰富，这是肯定的。他们也是最早适应并创建空降部队的人，例如。所以，是的，我认为有理由这么说，但斩首行动是绝对残酷的。如果你斩首了一支军队，你就得任命新的人来负责。一个在纸面上看起来像个还不错的和平时期指挥官的人，可能不是一个很好的战时指挥官。这是不同的学科和不同的技能，你只有在经受考验后才知道。这很难判断。当然，斯大林一直生活在偏执和猜疑的真空中，这在你试图发展一支强大的武装力量时是无益的。所以他们在1939年底进入芬兰，被打得很惨。他们确实占领了大约50%的领土，得到了卡累利阿半岛，并确实占领了一些土地，但付出了巨大的代价。我的意思是，伤亡是芬兰人的五倍，这是一个耻辱。所以希特勒看到了，心想：“哦，好吧，他们不怎么样。”然后希特勒输掉了不列颠之战，他想：“我不能同时打两线战争。”这是德国在1914年至18年输掉战争的原因之一，就是在东线作战，同时也在西线作战。“我们必须避免这种情况，但我必须除掉英国。而英国还没有退出战斗。英国在1940年底仍在战斗，赢得了不列颠之战。所以，也许我现在就进入苏联，趁红军还很弱。我们自己也没有100%准备好，但让我们加快整个进程。”因为最初，他一直在考虑在1943年或1944年计划一次行动。所以想法是，你先拿下波兰，再拿下法国和低地国家，你征服了西欧的大部分地区，你击败了英国，所以，你就不必太担心美国，因为他们在大西洋的另一边。这就给了他，为他赢得了时间，来重建他的力量，以全力进攻苏联。1940年未能征服英国，改变了所有这些计划，让他觉得：“实际上，我要提前行动。”而且他也有点，他被自己的聪明反噬了，因为他开始相信自己的天才。每个人都告诉他，他打不过法国和低地国家。每个人都告诉他，当他进入波兰时，事情不会顺利，每个人都非常紧张。“好吧，去你的，谨慎的、糟糕的贵族普鲁士将军们。我才是最棒的。我告诉过你们，我向你们展示过。我是天才。我能做到。”他开始相信自己的炒作。当然，这是一个问题。他被一群谄媚者包围，这些人不断地告诉他，他是一个不可思议的天才。所以他开始相信了，他认为一切皆有可能。他非常信奉这种德国人民的意志的观念，“这是我们的命运，我有一个意志。”就像我之前说的，要么是千年帝国，要么是世界末日，“但势头在我们这边，我们必须抓住它，只有通过赌博，只有通过大胆，德国人才能获胜，”以及所有这类胡说八道。所以这就是为什么他在1941年6月进入苏联，而不是几年后。</p>

        <h2>希特勒对阵欧洲 (Hitler vs Europe)</h2>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Is there a case to be made that there, he was indeed, at times a military genius?</p>
        <p class="chinese">是否有理由认为，他在某些时候确实是一位军事天才？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">No, I don’t think so. Because none of the plan, I mean, even the plan for the invasion of France and the Low Countries isn’t his. The concept is from Manstein’s, and the execution is Guderian’s, Heinz Guderian. Heinz Guderian is the pioneer of the Panzer force, the Panzer thrust, this idea of the ultra mechanized combined arms, Panzer arm spearhead doing this kind of lightning fast thrust. It’s not Hitler’s idea. He adopts it and takes it as his own, because he’s the führer. He can do what he likes, but it isn’t his. And up until that point, until that comes into being, until that plan is put forward to Franz Halder, who is the chief of staff of the German army at that time, Halder is just thinking, “How do we get out of this mess? This is just a nightmare.” Because they know that France has got a larger army, they know that France has got more tanks, and know that France has got double the number of artillery pieces. It’s got parity in terms of air force. And then you add Holland, then you add Belgium, then you add Great Britain. And that looks like a very, very tough nut to crack. I mean, the reason why France is subdued in 1940 is 50% brilliance of the Germans and their operational art in that particular instance, and 50% French failure really, and incompetence.</p>
        <p class="chinese">不，我不这么认为。因为没有哪个计划，我的意思是，即使是入侵法国和低地国家的计划也不是他的。这个概念来自曼施坦因，执行者是古德里安，海因茨·古德里安。海因茨·古德里安是装甲部队的先驱，装甲突击，这种超机械化合成兵种、装甲部队矛头进行闪电般快速突击的想法。这不是希特勒的想法。他采纳了它，并把它当作自己的，因为他是元首。他可以为所欲为，但那不是他的。直到那个时候，直到那个计划出现，直到那个计划被提交给当时德国陆军参谋长弗朗茨·哈尔德，哈尔德一直在想：“我们怎么摆脱这个烂摊子？这简直是场噩梦。”因为他们知道法国有更庞大的军队，他们知道法国有更多的坦克，并且知道法国的火炮数量是他们的两倍。在空军方面，双方势均力敌。然后你再加上荷兰，再加上比利时，再加上大不列颠。那看起来像一个非常、非常难啃的硬骨头。我的意思是，1940年法国被征服的原因，50%是德国人的才华和他们在那个特定情况下的作战艺术，50%是法国的失败，真的，还有无能。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">I mean, there is a kind of genius to be able to see, and take advantage, and set up the world stage in such a way that you have the appeasement from France and Britain, keep the United States out of it, just set up the world stage where you could just plow through everybody with very little resistance. I mean, there is a kind of geopolitical genius.</p>
        <p class="chinese">我的意思是，能够看到、利用并以某种方式设置世界舞台，让法国和英国采取绥靖政策，让美国置身事外，仅仅是设置一个你可以几乎毫无抵抗地横扫所有人的世界舞台，这本身就是一种天才。我的意思是，这是一种地缘政治的天才。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">If it works. But it doesn’t. That’s a problem. I mean, he goes into Poland on the assumption that Britain and France will not declare war. He is not prepared for Britain and France declaring war on Germany. He thinks they won’t. That’s right. So miscalculation, blunder. But then France does, right? And then France does not successfully do anything with this incredible army that it has. It has the size. But one of the problems that France has is that it’s very, very top-heavy. It’s very cumbersome in the way it operates. There’s no question that it’s got some brilliant young commanders, but at the top, the commanders are very old. Most of them are first World War veterans, whether, I mean, Weygand, Gamelin, General Georges, these people, they’re all well into their 60s. General Georges is the youngest army commander and he’s 60. It’s too old to be an army commander. You need to be in your late 40s, early 50s. And they’re too just consumed by conservatism and the old ways. And what they assume is that any future war will be much like the first World War. It’ll be attritional, long and drawn out, but static. But actually they’re right on two parts of it. As it turns out, it is going to be long, and drawn out, and attritional, but it’s going to be mobile rather than static. And that’s a big miscalculation.</p>
        <p class="chinese">如果成功的话。但它没有成功。那是个问题。我的意思是，他入侵波兰是基于英国和法国不会宣战的假设。他没有准备好英国和法国对德国宣战。他认为他们不会。没错。所以这是误判，是失误。但法国确实宣战了，对吧？然后法国并没有用它那支不可思议的军队成功地做任何事。它有规模。但法国的一个问题是，它非常、非常头重脚轻。它的运作方式非常笨重。毫无疑问，它有一些出色的年轻指挥官，但在高层，指挥官们都非常年迈。他们大多数都是第一次世界大战的老兵，无论是魏刚、甘末林、乔治将军，这些人，他们都已经60多岁了。乔治将军是最年轻的集团军司令，他已经60岁了。当集团军司令太老了。你需要40多岁末、50多岁初。他们太沉迷于保守主义和旧的方式。他们假设未来的任何战争都会很像第一次世界大战。它会是消耗性的、漫长而持久的，但会是静态的。但实际上他们在其中两个方面是对的。事实证明，它将是漫长而持久的，并且是消耗性的，但它将是机动的而不是静态的。那是一个大的误判。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Here’s my question. I think you’re being too nice on France, here. So when Germany invaded Poland, correct me if I’m wrong, but it feels like France could have just went straight to Berlin.</p>
        <p class="chinese">我的问题是。我觉得你对法国太客气了。所以当德国入侵波兰时，如果我错了请纠正我，但感觉法国本可以直接打到柏林。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Yeah, they absolutely could have. And I know you said, “It’s very top-heavy,” and you’re saying all of these things, but they literally did basically nothing. Yeah, they were appalling. And I think a part of that, and I think you described this well, maybe you could speak to that, is the insanity that is Hitler creating the psychological, with the propaganda, creating this feeling that there’s this Nazi force that’s unstoppable, so France just didn’t want to step into that. Maybe there were legitimately, I hesitate to say these words, but scared of war. A hundred percent they are, because France has been totally traumatized by the first World War. It’s fought on their land, it’s fought in their industrial heartland. They lose three times the amount of people killed that Britain does. Britain’s traumatized by it, but not to the same degree that France is. There is just no stomach to do that again. So that makes them risk averse. And by being risk averse, you’re actually taking a far greater risk. That’s the irony of it. And the truth is also there isn’t the political will. And a successful military can only be successful if there is a political will at the top. And the problem with France in the 1930s is it’s very politically divided. It’s a time of multiple governments, multiple prime ministers, coalition governments, really very extreme coalition governments from the sort of drawn from the left and the right as well as the center. And this is not a coalition of two parties. This is a coalition of multiple parties. No one can ever agree anything. I mean, that’s the problem. It’s amazing that the Maginot Line has even agreed, this incredibly strong defensive position down the western side of France border with Germany, which is kind of largely impregnable. But the problem is the bit that’s not impregnable, which is the hinge where the Maginot Line ends, and it sort of basically starts turning towards in a northerly direction and the border with Belgium. And what they should have done is built border defenses all along the northern coast of Belgium, because Belgium refused to allow any allied troops into its territory. It was neutral. And France should have said, “Okay, fine. Well, then we’ll defend. We’re not going to come to your rescue if you get invaded. That’s the payoff. And the consequence of that, we are going to stop that, and we’re not going to be drawn into the neutral territory should Germany invade from the west.” But they don’t do that because of the psychological damage of having fought a war in exactly that area a generation earlier. And that’s the problem. Germany is so weakened by the invasion of Poland. There is literally nothing left. The back door into Western Germany is completely open. And so they do what they call the Saar offensive, but it’s not. It’s a kind of reconnaissance in force where they go across the border, pick their noses for a few days, and then trundle back again. And it’s embarrassing. And what you’re seeing there is a nation which is just not ready for this, which is scared, which is politically divided, which is then having a knock on effect on the decision-making process, and which is just consumed by military complacency. And that’s the big problem. There is this, the commanders at the very top of the French regime are complacent. They haven’t bought into modern ways. They haven’t looked at how contemporary technology could help them. I mean, it is absurd, for example, that there isn’t a single radio in the Chateau de Vincennes, which, it’s the headquarters of the commander in chief of the French armed forces to General Maurice Gamelin. I mean, it’s just unbelievable. But that is the case. And there’s no getting away from that. And it is all the more ironic when you consider that France is actually the most automotive society in Europe. It’s the second most automotive society in the world after the United States, by some margin, it has to be said as well. It has a fantastic transportation system. Railway network is superb. There are eight people for every motorized vehicle in France, which is way above Germany, which is in 1949, that figure is 47, for example. So France is very mechanized, like- Very mechanized. So come on, guys, pull your finger out, get it together. And they just don’t. They’re incredibly slow and cumbersome. And what they think is what will happen is the Germans won’t think of going, they won’t do a pincer movement because you can’t possibly take motorized forces through the Ardennes. That just is not possible, which is the hinge area between the end of the Maginot, the northern part of the Maginot Line, which runs down the eastern border of France and the northern bit. And so, “What we’ll do with that hinge around the town of Sedan, we’ll move into Belgium, we’ll meet the Germans before they get anywhere near France. We’ll hold them. And while we’re holding them, we will bring up our reserves, and then we’ll counterattack, and crush them.” That’s the idea behind it. But the problem is they don’t have a means of moving fast. And their communication systems are dreadful, absolutely dreadful. They’re dependent on conventional telephone lines, which dive bombers and whatever are just absolutely wrecking. Suddenly the streets are clogged with refugees and people can’t move. So then telephone lines are down, there’s no radios, so that you’re then dependent on sending dispatch riders on little motorbikes. General Maurice Gamelin sends out a dispatch rider at six o’clock in the morning. By 12 o’clock he hasn’t come back, so you then send another one. Finally, the answer comes back, nine o’clock at night, by which time the Germans advance another 15 miles. And the original message that you sent at six o’clock that morning is completely redundant and has passed its sell by date. And that’s happening every step of the way. So you’ve got overall command headquarters, then you’ve got army group, then you’ve got army, then you’ve got corps, then you’ve got division. So the consequence of all that is that French just can’t move. They’re just stuck. They’re rabbits in headlights, and the Germans are able to move them, destroy them in isolation. Meanwhile, they’re able to use their excellent communications to very, very good effect. And you were talking about the genius of war. It’s not Hitler that’s a genius. If anyone’s a genius, it’s Goebbels, the propaganda chief. And it is their ability to harness that they are the kings of messaging. They don’t have X, don’t have social media, but they do have new technology. And that new technology, that new approach is flooding the airwaves with their singular message, which is always the same, and has been ever since the Nazis come into power, and it is using radios. And I think radios are really, really key to the whole story because there is no denser radio network anywhere in the world, including the United States, than Germany in 1939. So while it’s really behind the times in terms of mechanization, it is absolutely on top of its game in terms of comms. So 70% of households in Germany have radios by 1939, which is an unprecedented number. That is only beaten by United States and only just. So it is greater than any other nation in Europe. And in terms of flooding the airwaves, it is the densest, because even for those who, the 30% who don’t have radios, “That’s not a problem because we’ll put them in the stairwells of apartment blocks, we’ll put them in squares, we’ll put them in cafés and bars. And the same stuff, the Nazi state controls the radio airwaves as it does the movies, as it does newspapers, all aspects of the media are controlled by Goebbels and propaganda ministry. And they are putting out the same message over and over again. It’s not all Hitler’s ranting, it’s entertainment, light entertainment, some humorous shows. It is also Wagner, of course, and Richard Strauss. It’s a mixture. But the subliminal message is the same. “We’re the best. We’re the top dogs. Jewish Bolshevik plot is awful. That’s the existential threat to us. We have to overcome that. We’re the top dogs, militarily, we’re the best. We should feel really good about ourselves. We’re going to absolutely win and be the greatest nation in the world ever. And Hitler’s a genius.” And that is just repeated over, and over, and over, and over again. And for all the modernity of the world in which we live in today, most people believe what they’re told repeatedly. They still do. If you just repeat, repeat, repeat over and over again, people will believe it. If you are a diehard Trump supporter, you want to believe that, you’ll believe everything he says. If you are a diehard Bernie Sanders man, you’re from the left. You’ll believe everything he says because it’s reinforcing what you already want to believe. And that is exactly what Hitler, and the Nazis, and Goebbels, are doing in the 1930s. Well, they’re doing it in the 1920s as well, but more effectively once they come into power, of course. And Hitler is so fortunate that he comes, he takes over the chancellorship in January, 1933, at a time where the economy is just starting to turn. And he’s able to make the most of that. And if you’re Germans, and you’ve been through hyperinflation in the early 1920s, you’ve been through the humiliation of Versailles Treaty, which was terrible error, in retrospect. And you’ve been through, then having got through that, you’ve emerged into a democratic Weimar Republic, which is based on manufacturing. Germany’s traditional genius engineering, and manufacturing, and production of high quality items. They’re merging through that. Then you have the Wall Street crash. And the loans that are coming in from America, which is propping up the entire German economy, suddenly get cut off, and you’ve suddenly got depression again, and massive unemployment. And suddenly Hitler comes in and everyone’s got jobs, and they’re rebuilding, and they’re growing their military. And the message that’s coming out is, “We’re the greatest. We’re the best. We’re fantastic.” I was telling you earlier on about Hitler’s speeches, starting with the dark, starting dark and ending in hope, and light, and the sunlit uplands, that’s what you’re getting. You’re suddenly getting this vision of hope. This is sort of, “My God. Actually, this is really working. Okay, so I’m not sure that I particularly buy into the kind of anti-Semitic thing, but we’ll sweep that under the carpet because overall, I’ve now got a job. I’ve got money, I’ve got my new radio.” And then this is a genius about the radios, for example. So they have the German receiver to start off with, the \[German 00:50:38\] and then they have the \[German 00:50:41\], which is the German little receiver, little radio. These are genius. This is as outrageous as the arrival of the iPod. I mean, remember that? Suddenly you don’t have to have a Sony Walkman anymore. You can have something really, really small and miniature, and listen to thousands, of thousands, of thousands of songs all at once. What an amazing thing. And the \[German 00:51:00\] is nine inches by four inches by four inches. It’s made of Bakelite. And everyone can have one because it’s super cheap. It’s just incredible. And no one else has said that, because up until that point, radios, generally speaking, are aspirational. They’ve got sort of a walnut lacquer at the front, and you have them if you’re middle class, and you show them off to your neighbors to show how affluent and well-to-do you are, but suddenly everyone can have one. And if everyone can have one, then everyone can receive the same message. And you can also. And this is the whole point about the Hitler youth as well. The young guys, that’s where they’re most impressionistic. They’re least risk averse. So they’re most gung ho. They’re most full of excitement for the possibilities of life. And they’re also, their minds are the most opened to suggestion. So you get the youth, you hang on, you get them. And so a whole generation of young men are brought up thinking about the genius of Hitler and how he’s delivering this much better nation, and returning, overhauling the humiliations of the first World War, were overcoming the stab in the back that happened in 1918, et cetera, et cetera. And as a young 16, 17-year-old German, you’re thinking, “Yeah, I want a piece of that. And hey, guess what? They’ve got really cool uniforms, and come and join the SS, and get the throw line. What’s not to like?” You can see why it’s so clever. And what’s so interesting is propaganda today is still using those tenets that Goebbels was using back in the 1930s. And this is why I say that history doesn’t repeat itself. Of course it doesn’t. It can’t possibly repeat itself because we’re always living in a constantly evolving time. But patterns of human behaviour do. And what you always get after economic crisis is political upheaval, always, always, always. Because some people are in a worse off position than they were financially before. They’re thinking, “Well, the current system doesn’t work. What’s the alternative?” So in the case of now, we in the West, first of all, we’ve faced the financial crisis of 2008. Then we’ve had the double whammy of COVID. And that has been incredibly unsettling. And so we’re now in a situation of political turmoil. And whether you are pro-Trump or anti-Trump, what he’s offering is something completely different. And he’s saying, “The old ways don’t work. I’m just going to say what I think. I’m going to come out. I’m not going to bother with all the sheen of diplomacy and mealy mouth words that politicians always use, where you can’t trust anyone. I’m just going to tell you as it is.” And obviously people respond to that. You can understand why that has an appeal. And if the country already feels broken, and here’s someone who is going to be a disruptor, and going to change the way you go about things, you can see why a reasonably large proportion of the population is going to go, “I’ll have a piece of that. Thank you very much.”</p>
        <p class="chinese">是的，他们绝对可以。我知道你说：“它非常头重脚轻”，而且你说的所有这些，但他们实际上基本上什么也没做。是的，他们很糟糕。我认为其中一部分，而且我认为你描述得很好，也许你可以谈谈，是希特勒的疯狂，他用宣传创造了一种心理，创造了一种感觉，即这支纳粹军队是不可阻挡的，所以法国根本不想介入。也许他们确实，我犹豫着要不要说这些话，但他们害怕战争。他们百分之百害怕，因为法国已经被第一次世界大战彻底创伤了。战争在他们的土地上，在他们的工业中心地带进行。他们损失的人数是英国的三倍。英国也因此受到创伤，但程度不如法国。他们根本没有再次发动战争的意愿。所以这让他们变得规避风险。而通过规避风险，你实际上承担了更大的风险。这就是讽刺之处。真相是，也没有政治意愿。一个成功的军队只有在高层有政治意愿时才能成功。而1930年代法国的问题在于，它在政治上非常分裂。那是一个多政府、多总理、联合政府的时期，而且是来自左右两翼以及中间派的非常极端的联合政府。这并非两个政党的联合。这是多个政党的联合。没有人能达成任何协议。我的意思是，这就是问题所在。令人惊讶的是，马其诺防线甚至都达成了协议，这条沿着法国与德国边境西侧的极其坚固的防御阵地，在很大程度上是坚不可摧的。但问题在于，那部分并非坚不可摧的地方，也就是马其诺防线的终点，它基本上开始向北转，与比利时接壤。他们本应沿着比利时北部海岸建造边境防御工事，因为比利时拒绝任何盟军进入其领土。它是中立的。法国本应说：“好吧，那我们就自己防御。如果你被入侵，我们不会来救你。这就是代价。其后果是，我们将阻止这一切，我们不会在德国从西部入侵时被卷入中立领土。”但他们没有这样做，因为一代人前在完全相同的地区打了一场战争，留下了心理创伤。这就是问题所在。德国因入侵波兰而如此虚弱。几乎什么都没剩下。通往德国西部的后门完全敞开。所以他们进行了所谓的“萨尔攻势”，但那不是攻势。那是一种武力侦察，他们越过边境，闲逛了几天，然后又慢悠悠地回来了。这很尴尬。你看到的是一个根本没有准备好的国家，一个害怕的国家，一个政治上分裂的国家，这反过来又对决策过程产生了连锁反应，一个完全沉浸在军事自满中的国家。这就是大问题。这个，法国政权最高层的指挥官们都 complacent（自满）。他们没有接受现代的方式。他们没有研究当代技术如何能帮助他们。我的意思是，这很荒谬，例如，在文森城堡（Chateau de Vincennes），也就是法国武装部队总司令莫里斯·甘末林将军（General Maurice Gamelin）的总部，竟然没有一台收音机。我的意思是，这简直令人难以置信。但事实就是如此。这一点毋庸置疑。当你考虑到法国实际上是欧洲最汽车化的社会时，这就更具讽刺意味了。它是世界上仅次于美国的第二大汽车化社会，而且必须说，差距还不小。它有出色的交通系统。铁路网非常棒。法国每八个人就有一辆机动车，这远远高于德国，例如，1949年，德国的这个数字是47。所以法国非常机械化，就像——非常机械化。所以，伙计们，加把劲，振作起来。但他们就是不。他们非常缓慢和笨拙。他们认为会发生的是，德国人不会想到去，他们不会进行钳形攻势，因为你不可能让摩托化部队穿过阿登森林。那根本不可能，那是马其诺防线终点与北部的铰链区，马其诺防线沿着法国东部边境和北部延伸。所以，“我们将在色当镇周围的那个铰链区，我们将进入比利时，我们将在德国人到达法国任何地方之前与他们会面。我们将拖住他们。当我们拖住他们时，我们将调集我们的预备队，然后我们将反击，并粉碎他们。”这就是背后的想法。但问题是他们没有快速移动的手段。他们的通讯系统很糟糕，绝对糟糕。他们依赖传统的电话线，而俯冲轰炸机之类的东西正在彻底摧毁这些电话线。突然间，街道上挤满了难民，人们无法移动。所以电话线断了，没有收音机，所以你只能依赖派遣摩托车信使。莫里斯·甘末林将军早上六点派出一个信使。到十二点他还没回来，所以你再派一个。最后，答案在晚上九点回来，那时德国人又前进了15英里。而你早上六点发出的原始信息已经完全过时，已经失效了。这在每一步都发生。所以你有总司令部，然后有集团军，然后有军，然后有师。所以所有这些的后果是，法国人根本无法移动。他们被困住了。他们就像车灯前的兔子，而德国人能够移动他们，孤立地消灭他们。与此同时，他们能够非常、非常有效地利用他们出色的通讯。你刚才谈到战争的天才。不是希特勒是天才。如果说有谁是天才，那就是宣传部长戈培尔。这是他们利用的能力，他们是信息传播的王者。他们没有X，没有社交媒体，但他们确实有新技术。而那项新技术，那种新方法，就是用他们单一的信息淹没电波，这个信息总是一样的，自纳粹上台以来一直如此，而且是使用收音机。我认为收音机对整个故事来说真的、真的至关重要，因为1939年德国的收音机网络是世界上任何地方，包括美国，都无法比拟的密集。所以，虽然在机械化方面它非常落后，但在通讯方面它绝对是顶尖的。到1939年，德国70%的家庭都有收音机，这是一个前所未有的数字。这个数字只被美国超过，而且只是勉强超过。所以它比欧洲任何其他国家都高。在淹没电波方面，它是最密集的，因为即使对于那些没有收音机的30%的人来说，“那也不是问题，因为我们会把它们放在公寓楼的楼梯间，我们会把它们放在广场上，我们会把它们放在咖啡馆和酒吧里。同样的东西，纳粹国家控制着广播电波，就像它控制电影、报纸一样，媒体的所有方面都由戈培尔和宣传部控制。他们一遍又一遍地发布同样的信息。这不全是希特勒的咆哮，还有娱乐、轻松的娱乐、一些幽默节目。当然还有瓦格纳和理查德·施特劳斯。这是一种混合。但潜台词是一样的。“我们是最棒的。我们是老大。犹太布尔什维克阴谋很糟糕。那是对我们的生存威胁。我们必须克服它。我们在军事上是老大，我们是最棒的。我们应该对自己感觉非常好。我们绝对会赢，成为世界上有史以来最伟大的国家。希特勒是个天才。”这只是一遍又一遍地重复。尽管我们今天生活的世界很现代，但大多数人还是相信他们被反复告知的事情。他们仍然相信。如果你只是重复、重复、再重复，人们就会相信。如果你是特朗普的铁杆支持者，你想相信，你就会相信他说的每一句话。如果你是伯尼·桑德斯的铁杆支持者，你来自左翼。你就会相信他说的每一句话，因为它强化了你已经想相信的东西。而这正是希特勒、纳粹和戈培尔在1930年代所做的。嗯，他们在1920年代也这么做，但当然，一旦他们掌权，就更有效了。希特勒很幸运，他是在1933年1月接任总理的，当时经济刚刚开始好转。他能够充分利用这一点。如果你是德国人，你经历过1920年代初的恶性通货膨胀，你经历过凡尔赛条约的羞辱，回想起来，那是一个可怕的错误。你经历了那些，然后进入了一个以制造业为基础的民主魏玛共和国。德国传统的工程天才、制造业和高质量产品的生产。他们正在从中崛起。然后你遇到了华尔街崩盘。来自美国的贷款，支撑着整个德国经济，突然被切断了，你又突然陷入了萧条和大规模失业。突然希特勒来了，每个人都有了工作，他们在重建，他们在发展他们的军队。传出的信息是：“我们是最伟大的。我们是最棒的。我们太棒了。”我之前跟你说过希特勒的演讲，从黑暗开始，以希望、光明和阳光普照的高地结束，你得到的就是这个。你突然得到了这个希望的愿景。这有点像，“我的天。实际上，这真的有效。好吧，所以我不确定我是否特别相信那种反犹太主义的东西，但我们会把那件事掩盖起来，因为总的来说，我现在有工作了。我有钱了，我有了我的新收音机。”然后，这是关于收音机的一个天才之处，例如。所以他们一开始有德国接收器，那个[德语]，然后他们有[德语]，也就是德国小接收器，小收音机。这些都是天才。这就像iPod的出现一样令人震惊。我的意思是，还记得吗？突然你不需要索尼随身听了。你可以有一个非常、非常小的微型设备，一次听成千上万、成千上万、成千上万的歌曲。多么了不起的事情。而那个[德语]是九英寸乘四英寸乘四英寸。它是用胶木做的。每个人都能拥有一个，因为它超级便宜。这简直不可思议。而且没有其他人说过，因为在那之前，收音机，总的来说，是令人向往的。它们前面有那种胡桃木漆，如果你是中产阶级，你就会有它们，你会向你的邻居炫耀，以显示你有多富裕、多有地位，但突然每个人都能拥有一个。如果每个人都能拥有一个，那么每个人都能收到同样的信息。你也可以。这就是希特勒青年团的全部意义所在。年轻人，他们最容易受影响。他们最不规避风险。所以他们最冲动。他们对生活的可能性最充满兴奋。而且，他们的思想最容易接受暗示。所以你得到了年轻人，你坚持住，你得到了他们。所以整整一代年轻人都是在思考希特勒的天才，以及他如何带来这个更好的国家，如何扭转第一次世界大战的屈辱，如何克服1918年发生的背后捅刀子等等等等中长大的。作为一个16、17岁的德国年轻人，你会想：“是的，我也想分一杯羹。嘿，你猜怎么着？他们有非常酷的制服，来加入党卫军，拉上警戒线。有什么不好的呢？”你可以看出这有多聪明。有趣的是，今天的宣传仍在沿用戈培尔在1930年代使用的那些原则。这就是为什么我说历史不会重演。当然不会。它不可能重演，因为我们总是生活在一个不断发展的时代。但人类行为的模式会。经济危机之后，你总会遇到政治动荡，总是，总是，总是。因为有些人的财务状况比以前更糟。他们在想：“嗯，现在的制度行不通。有什么替代方案？”所以在现在的情况下，我们西方，首先，我们面临了2008年的金融危机。然后我们又遭受了COVID的双重打击。这非常令人不安。所以我们现在处于政治动荡的局面。无论你是支持特朗普还是反对特朗普，他提供的是完全不同的东西。他在说：“旧的方式行不通。我就说我想说的。我会站出来。我不会理会所有那些外交辞令和政客们总是使用的含糊其辞的话，你不能相信任何人。我就实话告诉你。”显然人们对此有反应。你可以理解为什么那有吸引力。如果国家已经感觉支离破碎，而这里有一个将成为颠覆者，将改变你做事方式的人，你可以理解为什么相当大一部分人会说：“我也想分一杯羹。非常感谢。”</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">And especially one of the countries in the economic crisis like Germany was, I think you’ve written that the Treaty of Versailles created Hitler and the Wall Street crash and the Great Depression brought him to power. And of course, the propaganda machine that you describe is the thing that got everybody else in Germany on board.</p>
        <p class="chinese">尤其是在像德国这样的经济危机国家，我认为你写过，《凡尔赛条约》创造了希特勒，而华尔街崩盘和大萧条则将他推上了权力宝座。当然，你所描述的宣传机器是让所有其他德国人也加入进来的原因。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Yep. It’s amazing, because he comes in with 33% of the vote. He had 37% of the vote in July, 1932. So again, this is another period of turmoil, just like it is in France, where you’re having constant different kind of coalitions and different chancellors, leaders of Germany. So it’s very possible he wouldn’t have come to power. Well, he said, “We will only take our seats if I can be chancellor, otherwise forget it. I’m not coming into any coalition.” So then the government falls again in January 1933. They have the election. The Nazi vote is down from where it was the previous summer, but this time they go, “Okay, Hitler can be chancellor, but we’ll manipulate him.” How wrong they were. He’s manipulating everyone. And then Hindenburg, who is the president, dies the following summer and he’s able to get rid of the presidency. There is no more president of Germany. There is just the führer, him and he gets rid of, he has, actually, Enabling act, which is where all other political parties are disbanded, and suddenly you’ve got a totalitarian state, just like that.</p>
        <p class="chinese">是的。这很惊人，因为他上台时只获得了33%的选票。他在1932年7月获得了37%的选票。所以，这又是另一个动荡时期，就像法国一样，你不断有各种不同的联盟和不同的总理，德国的领导人。所以他很可能不会上台。嗯，他说：“只有我能当总理，我们才会就座，否则就免谈。我不会加入任何联盟。”所以1933年1月政府再次倒台。他们举行了选举。纳粹的选票比前一个夏天有所下降，但这次他们说：“好吧，希特勒可以当总理，但我们会操纵他。”他们错得有多离谱。他操纵了所有人。然后，总统兴登堡在次年夏天去世，他得以废除了总统职位。德国不再有总统。只有元首，他，他废除了，他实际上通过了授权法案，所有其他政党都被解散了，突然之间，你就有了这样一个极权国家。</p>

        <h2>约瑟夫·戈培尔 (Joseph Goebbels)</h2>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">It is because it’s simple. And what Hitler does throughout the 1920s, is he sticks to this. There is actually, when he comes out of prison, so it is the Beer Hall Putsch in November, 1923, he gets charged with treason, which he has been, because he’s attempting a coup, and he gets sentenced to five years, which is pretty lenient for what he’s done. And he then gets let out after nine months. Nazi party is banned at that point, but then comes back into being. And the year that follows there is then a substantial debate about where the party should go. And there are actually a large number of people who think that actually they should be looking at how the Soviets are doing things and taking some of the things that they consider to be positive out of the communist state, and applying those to the Nazis. And Hitler goes, “No, no, no, no, no, no. We’ve just got to stick to this kind of Jewish Bolshevik thing. This is how we’re going to do it. This is how we’re going to do it.” Goebbels, for example, who is very open, Joseph Goebbels, he’s a not very successful journalist, but he does have a PhD in German literature. He’s very disaffected because he was born with talipes, which is more commonly known as a club foot. He’s disabled. He can’t fight in the first World War. He’s very frustrated by that. He’s in a deep despair about the state of Germany in the first part of the early 1920s. He’s looking for a political messiah, a sort of quasi-religious messiah, thinks it’s Hitler, then discovers that Hitler is not open to any ideas at all about any deviation, but then sees the light. Hitler recognizes that this guy is someone that he wants on his side, and so then goes to him, makes a real special effort. “Come on, come to dinner. I think you’re great,” All this kind of stuff. Wins it about over. And Goebbels has this complete vault fast, discards his earlier kind of, “Hitler’s right, I was wrong. Hitler is the kind of messiah figure that I want to follow. I want to follow the hero leader.” And they come aboard and they absolutely work. And Hitler completely wins out of all dissenters within what had been the German Workers party, drop, becomes the German National Socialist Party, becomes the Nazis. He comes out, emerges as the absolute, undisputed führer of that, leader of that party. And what he says goes, and everyone toes him behind it. And part of the genius of that, Hitler does have some genius. I just don’t think it’s military, but he does have some genius. And a question about is the simplicity of message. What he’s doing, it’s that us and them thing that we were talking about earlier on. It’s the kind of either/or. It’s kind of, “It’s my way or the highway.” It’s kind of, “This is the only way. This is how we get to the sunlit uplands. This is how create this amazing master race of this unification of German peoples, which dominates the world, which is the preeminent power in the world for the next thousand years, or its decay, and despair and being crushed by our enemies. And our enemies are the Jews and the Bolsheviks, the communists.” And what he taps into as well is [German] and [German]. There’s no direct English translation of [German] or indeed [German], but in its most basic form, it’s communities, it’s people, community or front veteran’s community. So the [German] is, “We are the guys. We are bonded because we were in the trenches. We were in the first World War. We were the people who bravely stuck it out, saw our friends being slaughtered and blown to pieces. We did our duty as proud Germans, but we were let down by the elites and we were let down by this Jewish Bolshevik plot. We were stabbed in the back.” The myth of the stabbing in the back is very, very strong. So, “We’re bound, we’re bonded by our experiences of the first World War and the fact that we did what we should and what we could. And we didn’t fail in what we were doing. We were failed by our leaders, by the elites.” So that’s [German]. [German] is this sense of national unity. It’s a cultural, ethnic bonding of people who speak German, who have a similar outlook on life. And again, that just reinforces the us and them. It reinforces the black and white worldview. And then you add that to this very simple message, which Hitler is repeating over and over again, “Communists are a big threat. Jews are a big threat. They’re the enemy.” You have to have an opposition in the them and us kind of process. And that’s what he’s doing. And people just buy into it. They go, “Yeah, we’re together. We’re Germans. We’re a brotherhood. We’ve got our [German].” So he cleverly ties into that and taps into that. But they’re an irrelevance by the late 1920s. By 1928, he’s not going to get a deal for Mein Kampf Part II, he’s impoverished. The party’s impoverished. Their numbers are down. They’re at best an irrelevance.</p>
        <p class="chinese">这是因为它简单。希特勒在整个1920年代都坚持这一点。实际上，当他出狱时——那是1923年11月的啤酒馆政变——他被指控叛国罪，这是他应得的，因为他企图发动政变，他被判处五年徒刑，对于他所做的事来说，这已经很宽大了。然后他在九个月后被释放。当时纳粹党被禁止，但后来又恢复了。接下来的一年里，关于该党应走向何方，发生了激烈的辩论。实际上，有很多人认为，他们应该看看苏联是怎么做的，并从共产主义国家中吸取一些他们认为积极的东西，并将其应用于纳粹。而希特勒说：“不，不，不，不，不，不。我们必须坚持这种犹太布尔什维克的东西。这就是我们要做的。这就是我们要做的。”例如，戈培尔，约瑟夫·戈培尔，他非常开放，他是一个不太成功的记者，但他确实拥有德国文学博士学位。他非常不满，因为他出生时患有马蹄内翻足，也就是俗称的“畸形足”。他是残疾人。他不能参加第一次世界大战。他对此非常沮丧。在1920年代初，他对德国的状况深感绝望。他在寻找一位政治救世主，一种准宗教的救世主，他认为是希特勒，然后发现希特勒对任何偏离的想法都完全不开放，但后来他看到了曙光。希特勒认识到这个人是他想要的人，所以他去找他，做出了特别的努力。“来吧，来吃晚饭。我觉得你很棒，”诸如此类的话。赢得了他的支持。戈培尔彻底转变，放弃了他早先的看法：“希特勒是对的，我错了。希特勒是我想要追随的那种救世主形象。我想追随这位英雄领袖。”他们加入了，并且绝对有效。希特勒完全战胜了曾经是德国工人党的所有异议者，该党解散，成为德国国家社会主义党，成为纳粹。他脱颖而出，成为该党绝对、无可争议的领袖。他说的话就是命令，每个人都紧随其后。这其中的天才之处在于，希特勒确实有一些天才，我只是不认为那是军事方面的，但他确实有一些天才。一个问题在于信息的简单性。他所做的，是我们之前谈到的“我们”和“他们”的事情。这是一种“非此即彼”的模式。有点像“要么听我的，要么滚蛋。”有点像“这是唯一的路。这是我们通往阳光普照的高地的方式。这是我们创造这个由德国人民统一而成的、统治世界的、在未来一千年里成为世界卓越力量的伟大优等民族的方式，否则就是衰败、绝望和被我们的敌人粉碎。而我们的敌人就是犹太人和布尔什维克，共产主义者。”他还利用了“Volksgemeinschaft”（人民共同体）和“Frontgemeinschaft”（前线共同体）。“Volksgemeinschaft”或“Frontgemeinschaft”没有直接的英语翻译，但最基本的形式是社区、人民、共同体或前线老兵共同体。所以“Frontgemeinschaft”是：“我们是兄弟。我们因在战壕里、在第一次世界大战中而紧密相连。我们是勇敢地坚持下来，眼睁睁看着朋友被屠杀、被炸得粉碎的人。我们作为自豪的德国人尽了我们的职责，但我们被精英们出卖了，被这个犹太布尔什维克阴谋出卖了。我们被背后捅了一刀。”背后捅刀子的神话非常、非常强大。所以，“我们因第一次世界大战的经历以及我们做了我们应该做的、我们能做的事实而联系在一起、团结在一起。我们在做的事情上没有失败。我们是被我们的领导人、被精英们出卖了。”所以那是“Frontgemeinschaft”。“Volksgemeinschaft”是这种民族团结感。它是一种讲德语、有相似人生观的人们的文化、民族的联系。这再次强化了“我们”和“他们”。它强化了黑白分明的世界观。然后你再加上希特勒一遍又一遍重复的这个非常简单的信息：“共产主义者是巨大的威胁。犹太人是巨大的威胁。他们是敌人。”在“我们”和“他们”的过程中，你必须有一个对立面。这就是他所做的。人们就相信了。他们说：“是的，我们在一起。我们是德国人。我们是兄弟。我们有我们的‘Volksgeme'nschaft’。”所以他巧妙地利用并融入了这一点。但到1920年代末，他们已经无足轻重了。到1928年，他无法为《我的奋斗》第二部拿到合同，他很穷。党也很穷。他们的人数减少了。他们充其量是无足轻重的。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Which is say he wrote Mein Kampf at this time, when he was in prison.</p>
        <p class="chinese">也就是说，他是在这个时候，在监狱里，写了《我的奋斗》。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Well, he writes most of Mein Kampf in Landsberg prison. And then he writes the rest of it in what becomes known as the [German], which is this little wooden hut in the Obersalzberg. And you can still see the remnants of that. And unfortunately, there’s still little candles there and stuff in the woods by neo-Nazis and whatnot, what have you. But that’s where he wrote the rest of it. I mean, it Jean-Jacques Rousseau who says, “Man has his greatest thought when surrounded by nature.” That was something that Hitler took very much to heart. There was a mentor of his called Dietrich Eckart. Dietrich Eckart introduced him to the Obersalzberg and the beauty of the southeast Bavarian Alps around Berchtesgaden. And that was his favorite place on the planet, and that’s where he eventually bought the Berghof with the royalties, it has to be said, from Mein Kampf, which went from being almost pulp to suddenly being a runaway bestseller, unfortunately.</p>
        <p class="chinese">嗯，他在兰茨贝格监狱写了《我的奋斗》的大部分内容。然后他在后来被称为“Kampfhäusl”（奋斗小屋）的地方写完了剩下的部分，那是在上萨尔茨堡山上的一个小木屋。你现在仍然可以看到它的遗迹。不幸的是，林子里还有新纳粹分子留下的蜡烛之类的东西。但那就是他写完其余部分的地方。我的意思是，是让-雅克·卢梭说的：“当人被大自然包围时，他会有最伟大的思想。”希特勒非常认同这一点。他有一个导师叫迪特里希·埃卡特。迪特里希·埃卡特向他介绍了上萨尔茨堡山以及贝希特斯加登周围东南巴伐利亚阿尔卑斯山的美景。那是他地球上最喜欢的地方，他最终用《我的奋斗》的版税在那里买下了贝格霍夫庄园，必须说，《我的奋斗》从几乎无人问津，不幸地突然变成了畅销书。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Can you actually comment on that? It’s a shitty manifesto as far as manifestos go. I think there’s a lot of values to understand from a first person perspective, the words of a dictator, of a person like Hitler. But it just feels like that’s just such a shitty-</p>
        <p class="chinese">你真的可以评论一下吗？就宣言而言，那是一份糟糕的宣言。我认为从第一人称的角度理解一个独裁者、一个像希特勒这样的人的话语，有很多价值。但感觉那只是一份很糟糕的——</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Yeah, I mean it’s banned in a number of countries. You don’t need to, because no one’s going to read it, because it’s unreadable. I mean, it’s very untidy. It’s very incoherent. There’s no narrative arc, to use a writer’s phrase. I mean, but it does give you a very clear, the overall impression you get at the end of it is the communists and the Jews are to blame for everything. Oh, no. He’s hungry for war. It’s a pretty unique way of speaking, allowing violence as a tool in this picture, that there’s a hierarchy, that there is a superior race and inferior races, and it’s okay to destroy the inferior ones. Yeah. Usually politicians don’t speak that way. They just say, “Well, here’s good and evil. We’re the good guys. And yeah, maybe we’ll destroy the evil a little bit.” Now here is like there’s a complete certainty about a very large number of people, “The Slavic people, they just need to be removed.” “Well, they need to be made in irrelevance. We have to take it. We have to take it. And in fact, if that kills millions of them, fine. Then they can sort of squish that way over to Siberia or- ” “We just need to populate this land that belongs to the German people.” Yeah. “Because they’re the superior people.” There’s no question that he glorified violence and war. He’s absolutely chomping at the bit. And in a way, I think he’s a bit disappointed that in the 1930s, the conquests that he does undertake are also peaceful. March 1938 goes straight into Austria. There’s the Anschluss, not a shot is fired. 1936, goes into the Rhineland, reconquers that, retakes that over from the occupying allies, not a shot is fired. He takes the Sudetenland, barely a shot is fired, and then goes into the rest of Czechoslovakia in March, 1939. And again, barely a shot is fired. And it’s a bit disappointing. He wants to be tested. He wants to have the wartime triumph. You can see him being frustrated about this in the Munich crisis in 1938. He wants to fight. He’s absolutely spoiling for it. He’s desperate to go in. He’s all ready and gung ho. He’s built his Luftwaffe. He is got his Panzers now. He’s got his massive armed forces. He wants to test them. He wants to get the show on the road and prove it. He is an arch gambler, Hitler.</p>
        <p class="chinese">是的，我的意思是，它在很多国家都被禁止了。你不需要禁，因为没人会读它，因为它根本读不下去。我的意思是，它非常杂乱。它非常不连贯。用作家的话说，没有叙事弧线。我的意思是，但它确实给你一个非常清晰的印象，读完之后，你得到的总体印象是共产主义者和犹太人是一切的罪魁祸首。哦，不。他渴望战争。这是一种非常独特的说话方式，允许将暴力作为这张图景中的一个工具，即存在一个等级制度，存在一个优等种族和劣等种族，摧毁劣等种族是可以的。是的。通常政治家不这样说话。他们只会说：“嗯，这里有好有坏。我们是好人。是的，也许我们会稍微摧毁一下邪恶。”而这里就像是，对非常多的人有一种完全的确定性，“斯拉夫人，他们只需要被清除。”“嗯，他们需要被边缘化。我们必须拿下它。我们必须拿下它。事实上，如果那会杀死他们数百万，没关系。那他们就可以被挤到西伯利亚或者——”“我们只需要让属于德意志人民的这片土地上住满人。”是的。“因为他们是优等民族。”毫无疑问，他美化了暴力和战争。他绝对是摩拳擦掌。在某种程度上，我认为他对1930年代他进行的征服也是和平的感到有点失望。1938年3月直入奥地利。那是德奥合并（Anschluss），一枪未发。1936年，进入莱茵兰，重新征服那里，从占领的盟军手中夺回，一枪未发。他占领了苏台德地区，几乎一枪未发，然后在1939年3月进入捷克斯洛伐克的其余部分。同样，几乎一枪未发。这有点令人失望。他想被考验。他想获得战时的胜利。你可以看到他在1938年的慕尼黑危机中对此感到沮丧。他想打仗。他绝对是跃跃欲试。他迫不及待地想进去。他已经准备好了，斗志昂扬。他建立了他的德国空军。他现在有了他的装甲部队。他有了他庞大的武装力量。他想测试他们。他想让这场戏开演并证明它。他是一个顶级赌徒，希特勒。</p>

        <h2>1939年9月1日前的希特勒 (Hitler before WW2)</h2>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">You make it seem so clear, but all the while to the rest of the world, to Chamberlain, to France, to Britain, to the rest of the world, he’s saying he doesn’t want that. He’s making agreements. Everything you just mentioned, you just went through it so quickly. But those are agreements that were made that he’s not going to do that. And he does it over and over. He violates the Treaty of Versailles. He violates every single treaty. But he still is doing the meetings. So maybe can you go through it, the lead up to the war, 1939, September 1st, what are the different agreements? What is the signaling he’s doing? And what is he doing secretly in terms of building up the military force?</p>
        <p class="chinese">你说得如此清晰，但与此同时，对世界其他国家，对张伯伦，对法国，对英国，对世界其他国家，他都在说他不想那样。他在达成协议。你刚才提到的所有事情，你都说得很快。但那些都是他承诺不会做的协议。他却一再违背。《凡尔赛条约》，他违背了。每一项条约，他都违背了。但他仍然在开会。所以，你能否梳理一下，战争爆发前的那些日子，1939年9月1日，有哪些不同的协议？他发出了什么信号？在秘密建立军事力量方面，他又在做什么？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Yes. So part of the Treaty of Versailles, is you’re allowed very, very limited armed forces. There’s restrictions on naval expansion. There’s restrictions on the size of the army. There’s restrictions on the weapons you can use. You’re not allowed an air force. But he starts doing this all clandestinely. There are people in, Krupp has got, for example, which is in the Ruhr, a big armaments manufacturer. They are producing tanks elsewhere, and parts elsewhere in, say the Netherlands, for example, and then shipping them back into Germany. They’re doing Panzer training exercises actually in the Soviet Union at this time. There’s all sorts of things going on. The Luftwaffe has been announced to the world in 1935, but it’s obviously been in the process of developing long before that. The Messerschmitt 109, a single engine fighter plane, for example, is created in 1934. So they’re doing all these things against it. And the truth is, he’s just constantly pushing, “What can I get away with, here?” And of course, Britain, France, the rest of the world, the rest of the allies, they’re all reeling from the Wall Street crash and the depression as well. So have they got the stomach for this? Not really. And, “Perhaps actually on reflection, the terms of Versailles Treaty are bit harsh anyway, so maybe we don’t need to worry about it.” There’s just no political will. There’s no political will to fight against what Germany’s doing. Then he gets away of it. So he suddenly starts realizing that actually he can push this quite a long way, because no one’s going to stand up to him, which is why he makes a decision in 1936 to go back into the Rhineland, which has been occupied by French allied troops at that point. He just walks in, just goes, “Do your worst.” And no one’s going to do anything because there isn’t a stomach to do anything.</p>
        <p class="chinese">是的。所以《凡尔赛条约》的一部分是，你只被允许拥有非常、非常有限的武装力量。海军扩张有限制。陆军规模有限制。你可以使用的武器也有限制。你不被允许拥有空军。但他开始秘密地做这一切。有人，比如鲁尔区的克虏伯，一个大型军火制造商。他们在其他地方生产坦克，在荷兰等地生产零件，然后运回德国。他们当时实际上在苏联进行装甲部队的训练演习。各种事情都在发生。德国空军在1935年向世界宣布成立，但显然在此之前它已经发展了很长时间。例如，梅塞施密特109型单引擎战斗机是在1934年制造的。所以他们正在做所有这些违反条约的事情。而事实是，他只是在不断地试探，“我在这里能逃脱什么？”当然，英国、法国、世界其他国家、其他盟国，他们也都因华尔街崩盘和经济大萧条而摇摇欲坠。所以他们有勇气面对这个吗？并没有。而且，“也许实际上反思一下，《凡尔赛条约》的条款本来就有点苛刻，所以也许我们不必担心。”就是没有政治意愿。没有政治意愿去对抗德国正在做的事情。然后他就逃脱了。所以他突然开始意识到，实际上他可以把这件事推得很远，因为没人会站出来反对他，这就是为什么他在1936年决定重返莱茵兰，当时那里被法国盟军占领。他直接走了进去，就像在说，“你们尽管来吧。”没人会做什么，因为没人有那个胆量。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">That was a big step in 1936, remilitarizing the Rhineland. I mean, that That’s a huge, huge step of like, “Oh, I don’t have to follow anybody’s rules and they’re going to do nothing.”</p>
        <p class="chinese">1936年，莱茵兰的再军事化是一个重大举动。我的意思是，那是一个巨大的、巨大的举动，就像在说：“哦，我不需要遵守任何人的规则，他们也不会做什么。”</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">And he’s looking at his military and he’s also looking at response. So one of the things they do is really, it’s very clever. So they go over the head of the army of the air, Armee de L’Air, which is the French air force, and they invite him over. And Erhard Milch, who is the second command of the Luftwaffe invites him over. “So, come and see what we’re up to. You are our European neighbors, we’re all friends together,” this kind of stuff. “Come and see what we’ve got.” And he takes him to this airfield. There’s a row of Messerschmitt 109s all lined up, sort of 50 of them. And the head of the Armee of the Air looks at it and goes, “Krikey, that’s impressive.” And Milch goes, “Well, let me go and take you to another airfield.” And they go out of the back route out of the airfield and is a long circuitous route in the Mercedes. Meanwhile, all the Messerschmitts take off from that airfield, going to land on the next airfield. Here’s another one, and they’re all the same aircraft. And the commander-in-chief of the army of Vienna goes back to France and goes, “We’re never going to be able to beat Germany.” Earlier, you were alluding to this earlier on, how much is this, just this chutzpah of this ability to kind of portray the mechanized Moloch? Yeah, it absolutely cowls the enemy, so the increasing the effectiveness of their armed forces purely by propaganda and by mind games and by talking the talk. We might all think these military parades that the Nazis have looked rather silly by today’s standards, but you look what that looks like if you are the rest of the world. You’re in Britain, and you’re still reeling from the Depression, and you see the triumph of the will. You see some of that footage, and you see these automatons in their steel helmets, and you see the swastikas, and you see hundreds of thousands of people all lined up and seig heiling and all the rest of it, you are going to think again before you go into war with people like that.</p>
        <p class="chinese">他既在审视自己的军队，也在观察对方的反应。所以他们做的一件事，真的，非常聪明。他们绕过法国空军（Armee de l'Air），直接邀请其指挥官过来。德国空军的二号人物埃哈德·米尔希（Erhard Milch）邀请他。“来吧，看看我们在做什么。你们是我们的欧洲邻居，我们都是朋友，”诸如此类的话。“来看看我们有什么。”他带他去了一个机场。那里有一排梅塞施密特109战斗机，大概有50架。法国空军的负责人看了看，说：“天哪，真了不起。”米尔希说：“嗯，我带你去另一个机场吧。”他们从机场的后门出去，坐着梅赛德斯走了一条很长的迂回路线。与此同时，所有的梅塞施密特战斗机都从那个机场起飞，飞往下一个机场降落。又来了一批，而它们都是同一批飞机。法国空军的总司令回到法国后说：“我们永远也打不过德国。”之前，你早些时候就提到了这一点，这在多大程度上，仅仅是这种描绘机械化巨兽的胆量？是的，这绝对让敌人胆怯，所以他们通过纯粹的宣传、心理战和口头功夫来提高其武装力量的效力。我们可能都觉得纳粹的那些阅兵式按今天的标准看有点可笑，但如果你是世界其他国家，你看看那是什么样子。你在英国，你还在从大萧条中恢复，你看到了《意志的胜利》。你看到了一些那样的镜头，你看到那些戴着钢盔的机器人，你看到纳粹的万字旗，你看到成千上万的人排成一排，行纳粹礼，等等，你在与那样的人开战之前，会三思而后行。</p>

        <h2>希特勒对阵张伯伦 (Hitler vs Chamberlain)</h2>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">But at that time, that’s the real possibility. You remember World War I, you remember all of that. So okay, there’s a mad guy with a mustache. He’s making statements that this land belongs to Germany anyway, because it’s mostly German-populated, and like you said, Treaty of Versailles wasn’t really fair, and you can start justifying all kinds of things for yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And maybe they got a point about the Danzig Corridor. They are mainly Germans, German-speaking people there, and it’s disconnected from East Prussia, they’re saying, I sort of get it. Maybe they’ve got a point. And is Poland really a kind of thriving democracy, anyway? Not really. By 1930, late 1930s, it’s not. It’s, to all intents and purposes, a dictatorship in Poland at that time. I mean, it’s not right that you just go and take someone else’s country. Of course, you can’t do that. But you can see why in Germany people are thinking they’ve got a point. You can also see why in France and Britain, they’re thinking, “Do we really care about the Poles? I mean, is it worth going war over?” But there’s bigger things at play by this point. That’s the point.</p>
        <p class="chinese">但在那个时候，那是一种真实的可能性。你还记得第一次世界大战，你还记得所有那些。所以好吧，有一个留着小胡子的疯子。他发表声明说，这片土地无论如何都属于德国，因为它主要是德国人居住的，而且就像你说的，《凡尔赛条约》并不公平，你可以开始为自己辩解各种事情。是的，是的，是的。也许他们在但泽走廊的问题上说得有道理。那里主要是德国人，讲德语的人，而且它与东普鲁士是隔开的，他们说，我有点理解。也许他们说得有道理。而且，波兰真的算是一个繁荣的民主国家吗？并不。到1930年，1930年代末，它不是。在当时，波兰实际上是一个独裁国家。我的意思是，你不能就这么去占领别人的国家，这当然是不对的。当然你不能那么做。但你可以理解为什么在德国，人们认为他们说得有道理。你也可以理解为什么在法国和英国，他们在想：“我们真的关心波兰人吗？我的意思是，值得为此开战吗？”但到这个时候，有更大的事情在起作用。这就是重点。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Yeah, but before we get to Poland, there is this meeting, September 1938. So Chamberlain made three trips to meet with Hitler, which culminated in the Munich Conference. Yeah, on the 30th of September. Yeah. Where was Chamberlain, Hitler, Mussolini and Daladier, prime minister of France. They met to discuss essentially Czechoslovakia without any of the government officials of Czechoslovakia participating. And Hitler promised to make no more territorial conquests, and Chamberlain believed him. He chose to believe him, I think, is the thing, is the point. It’s very interesting. So Chamberlain gets a very bad press.</p>
        <p class="chinese">是的，但在我们谈到波兰之前，有一次会议，1938年9月。张伯伦三次会见希特勒，最终促成了慕尼黑会议。是的，在9月30日。是的。当时有张伯伦、希特勒、墨索里尼和法国总理达拉第。他们开会讨论捷克斯洛伐克问题，但没有任何捷克斯洛伐克政府官员参加。希特勒承诺不再进行领土征服，而张伯伦相信了他。我认为，关键在于他选择了相信他。这很有趣。所以张伯伦的名声很差。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Well, no. No, it’s not really uh-oh. I just think there’s too much retrospective view on this. And that’s fine because the whole point of history is you can look back and you can judge decisions that were made at a certain point through the prism of what subsequently happened, which, of course, the people that are making the decisions at the time can’t because they’re in that particular moment. So I don’t think Chamberlain did trust Hitler, but he wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Britain was not obliged to Czechoslovakia at all. France was. France had signed a treaty with Czechoslovakia in 1924, but Britain had not. So there was no obligation at all for Britain to do this. The only reason why Britain would go to war over Czechoslovakia is because of the threat of Nazism and what the ramifications of not going to war with him. There’s not really much argument for having a large army because if you have a large army, you’ve got to maintain it. Britain is a small place. Where do you put them? You’ve also got to transport them. That’s complicated. You’ve got to train them, you’ve got to put them in barracks, you’ve got to feed them, all this kind of stuff. There’s a kind of impracticality about having a large army. It is he that enables the air force and the air ministry to develop the first fully-coordinated air defense system anywhere in the world. There is not an air defense system in Poland, nor Norway, nor Denmark, nor the Netherlands, nor Belgium, nor France. There is in Britain, Britain is the only one, and frankly, it pays off big time in the summer of 1940. So you have to give him credit for that. Britain interestingly is also the world’s leading armaments exporter in the 1930s, which is amazing really when you think everyone complains about the fact that we weren’t rearming enough. Actually, we were when we had all the infrastructure there and we were expanding that infrastructure dramatically. I say we. I’m only saying that because I’m British. So they were doing that. In 1938, Britain wasn’t ready for war. Now you can argue that Germany wasn’t ready for war, either. But Chamberlain was prime minister in a democracy, a parliamentary democracy, where 92% of the population were against going to war in 1938. There was not a single democratic leader in the world that would go against the wishes of 92% of the population. Now you could say, ” Well, he should have just argued it better and presented his case better and all the rest of it.” But at that point, there was no legal obligation to go to the defense of Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was another of these new nations that been created out of 1919 and the Versailles Treaty. Who was to say we, in Britain, are able to judge the rights and wrongs of that? How fantastic it would be to go to war with a nation a long way away for people whom we know very little, et cetera, et cetera? I’m paraphrasing his quote. But I’m not saying it was the right decision. I’m just saying I can see why, in September 1938, he is prepared to give him a chance. Chamberlain comes back, and waves this little piece of paper, peace in our time and all the rest of it, which obviously comes back to bite him in a very big way. But it’s interesting that when Hitler then subsequently goes and moves and that they, France and Britain decide in rather the same way that there’s been discussion about deciding that large portions of Ukraine should just be handed back, handed over to Russia without consulting Ukraine a few weeks ago, it is incredible, I think, that France and Britain and Italy with Germany are deciding that, yes, it’s fine for Germany to go in and take Sudetenland without really consulting the Czechs. It’s a sort of similar kind of scenario really, and it’s equally wrong. But when Germany does then go and take over the whole of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, that’s the bottom line. That’s the point where Chamberlain goes, “Okay, I’ve given him the benefit of the doubt. No more benefits than doubt. That’s it. This is he’s crossed the line.” And so you reinforce your agreement with Poland, you do a formal agreement, you go, “Okay, we will uphold your sovereignty. If you are invaded, we will go to war with you.” And that is a ratcheting up of diplomacy in politics in a very, very big way. And it is that decision to make a treaty with the Poles is not heeded by Hitler, but it’s heeded by, literally, every one of his commanders. And it’s also heeded by Goring who is his number two, and who is obviously a commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe and is president of Prussia and all the rest of it and is the second-most senior Nazi. And he’s going, “This is a catastrophe. This is the last thing we want to be doing is going to war against Britain and, indeed, France.”</p>
        <p class="chinese">嗯，不。不，这不算是“糟糕”。我只是觉得，对这件事的回顾性看法太多了。这没关系，因为历史的全部意义就在于，你可以回过头来，通过后来发生的事情的棱镜来评判在某个特定时刻做出的决定，当然，当时做决定的人是做不到的，因为他们身处那个特定的时刻。所以我不认为张伯伦信任希特勒，但他想给他一个机会。英国完全没有义务保护捷克斯洛伐克。法国有。法国在1924年与捷克斯洛伐克签订了条约，但英国没有。所以英国完全没有义务这样做。英国唯一可能为捷克斯洛伐克开战的原因，是纳粹主义的威胁以及不与他开战的后果。拥有庞大陆军并没有太多论据，因为如果你有庞大陆军，你就得维持它。英国是个小地方。你把他们放在哪里？你还得运输他们。那很复杂。你得训练他们，把他们安置在兵营里，给他们提供食物，所有这些。拥有一支庞大陆军有点不切实际。正是他，使得空军和空军部能够发展出世界上第一个完全协调的防空系统。波兰、挪威、丹麦、荷兰、比利时、法国都没有防空系统。英国有，英国是唯一一个，坦率地说，这在1940年夏天收到了巨大的回报。所以你必须为此给他记上一功。有趣的是，英国在1930年代也是世界领先的军火出口国，这真的很了不起，当你想到每个人都在抱怨我们没有足够地重整军备时。实际上，我们当时有所有的基础设施，并且正在大幅扩展那些基础设施。我说我们。我这么说只是因为我是英国人。所以他们在那么做。1938年，英国还没有准备好战争。现在你可以说德国也没有准备好战争。但张伯伦是一个民主国家的首相，一个议会民主制国家，1938年92%的人口都反对开战。世界上没有一个民主领袖会违背92%的人口的意愿。现在你可以说，“嗯，他本可以更好地辩论，更好地陈述他的理由，等等。”但在那个时候，没有法律义务去保卫捷克斯洛伐克。捷克斯洛伐克是1919年和凡尔赛条约之后创建的这些新国家之一。谁能说我们英国有能力判断其中的是非曲直呢？为一个我们知之甚少的遥远国家的人民开战，那该有多棒，等等等等？我是在转述他的话。但我不是说那是一个正确的决定。我只是说我能理解为什么在1938年9月，他准备给他一个机会。张伯伦回来，挥舞着那张小纸片，说“我们时代的和平”等等，这显然后来给他带来了巨大的麻烦。但有趣的是，当希特勒随后行动，而他们，法国和英国，以一种相当类似的方式决定——就像几周前关于决定将乌克兰大片领土交还给俄罗斯而不咨询乌克兰的讨论一样——我认为，法国和英国以及意大利与德国决定，是的，德国可以进去占领苏台德地区而不真正咨询捷克人，这简直不可思议。这真的是一种类似的情景，而且同样是错误的。但当德国在1939年3月占领整个捷克斯洛伐克时，那就是底线了。那就是张伯伦说：“好吧，我给了他一个机会。再也没有机会了。就这样。他越界了。”所以你加强了你与波兰的协议，你签订了一项正式协议，你说：“好吧，我们将维护你的主权。如果你被入侵，我们将与你并肩作战。”这是外交和政治上的一次非常、非常大的升级。而这个与波兰人签订条约的决定，希特勒没有听进去，但他的每一个指挥官都听进去了。戈林也听进去了，他是希特勒的二号人物，显然是德国空军的总司令，也是普鲁士的总统，等等，是第二高级的纳粹。他说：“这是一场灾难。我们最不想做的事情就是与英国，以及法国开战。”</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">The Munich Conference is a pretty interesting moment, I would say in all of human history, because you got the leaders of these bigger-than-life nations and the most dramatic brewing conflict in human history, Chamberlain, Hitler, Mussolini, Daladier. It’s interesting when these bigger-than-life leaders are in a room together. Is there something that you know about their interactions?</p>
        <p class="chinese">慕尼黑会议是一个非常有趣的时刻，我会说在整个人类历史上都是如此，因为你把这些比生命还重要的国家的领导人，以及人类历史上最戏剧性的酝酿中的冲突，张伯伦、希特勒、墨索里尼、达拉第聚集在了一起。当这些比生命还重要的领导人同处一室时，这很有趣。你对他们的互动有什么了解吗？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Yeah, I think one of the things that’s interesting is that Hitler’s got home advantage because it’s on his turf and the start off at the first meeting is at the Berghof, his beloved place in the Obersalzburg overlooking Berchtesgaden in the Alps. So he’s pretty confident because, “This is my manor, this is my turf. I’m not going to be bossed around by these guys.” But Chamberlain, for example, he’s going there thinking, “I’ve been around the blocks. No one can teach me anything. I’ve been a politician for ages. I’m not going to be kind of capped out by this sort of Austrian upstart.” So they’re both coming at it with a slight kind of superiority kind of conflict. Interestingly, when you get to the actual meetings at the Führerbau in Munich a couple of weeks later, Chamberlain is cheered by the crowds when his car comes in, when he goes to his hotel, when he’s moving from his hotel to the Führerbau. There are cars cheering him, waving Union Jacks, all this kind of stuff. Hitler does not like that at all, not at all, puts him on the back foot. And that’s because the German people don’t want war, in the same way that the British people don’t want war, nor do the German people. The difference is that Hitler is a dictator and an autocrat and has the devotion of the people so he can do what he wants in a way that Chamberlain can’t. Chamberlain’s hands are tied because he is an elected prime minister, an elected leader, political leader, and he’s not head of state. So there is no question that it is Hitler and Chamberlain that are the top dogs in this particular discussion. Daladier takes the back seat. Even Mussolini, although he’s there, he doesn’t want war, either. He wants to be left alone to do his own thing without anyone getting in the way. But he doesn’t want, it’s not in his interest to have a European war so he’s trying to avoid it. So it is really, you see that the kind of alpha males in the room are Chamberlain and Hitler, and it’s really interesting because Hitler’s got this sort of slightly garrulous voice and very kind of pale blue eyes and such distinct features, quite a long nose. And he always says this is why he has the mustache is to kind of disguise the big nose. As I was saying to you earlier on before we started recording, he does have a sense of humor. It’s not one that you and I would kind of tap into, but he does have one. Whereas Chamberlain, he sounds like bit like an old man. He’s sort of silver-haired, and he looks like your sort archetypal kind of British gentleman with rolled-up umbrella and his Homburg hat and all the rest of it. So they’re both sort of caricatures in a funny sort of way. And yet, the consequence of these discussions, these great events happening, you are absolutely going, even which way the Munich crisis comes out, you’re taking a step closer to war. It’s just whether the war is going to happen next week or whether it’s going to happen a year, hence. But the Munich crisis obviously doesn’t stem the inevitability of war at all. It just heightens it.</p>
        <p class="chinese">是的，我认为有趣的一点是，希特勒有主场优势，因为那是在他的地盘上，第一次会议的起点是在贝格霍夫，他在上萨尔茨堡山心爱的地方，可以俯瞰阿尔卑斯山脉的贝希特斯加登。所以他很自信，因为，“这是我的地盘，这是我的领地。我不会被这些人颐指气使。”但张伯伦，例如，他去的时候心想：“我见多识广了。没人能教我什么。我当了这么多年政治家。我不会被这个奥地利暴发户压倒。”所以他们两人都带着一种轻微的优越感冲突来对待这件事。有趣的是，几周后当你在慕尼黑的元首官邸（Führerbau）举行实际会议时，当张伯伦的汽车驶入，当他去酒店，当他从酒店去元首官邸时，人群为他欢呼。有汽车为他欢呼，挥舞着英国国旗，诸如此类。希特勒一点也不喜欢那样，一点也不，那让他处于下风。那是因为德国人民不想要战争，就像英国人民不想要战争一样，德国人民也不想要。区别在于，希特勒是一个独裁者，一个专制君主，他拥有人民的忠诚，所以他可以为所欲为，而张伯伦不能。张伯伦束手无策，因为他是一位民选首相，一位民选领袖，政治领袖，而且他不是国家元首。所以毫无疑问，在这场特定的讨论中，希特勒和张伯伦是主角。达拉第退居二线。即使是墨索里尼，虽然他在场，他也不想要战争。他想一个人呆着，做自己的事，不受任何人的干扰。但他不想要，一场欧洲战争不符合他的利益，所以他试图避免它。所以真的，你看到房间里那种阿尔法男性是张伯伦和希特勒，这真的很有趣，因为希特勒有那种有点喋喋不休的声音，非常淡蓝色的眼睛，还有如此独特的特征，鼻子很长。他总是说这就是为什么他留胡子，是为了掩盖大鼻子。就像我之前录音前跟你说的，他确实有幽默感。不是你我会欣赏的那种，但他确实有。而张伯伦，他听起来有点像个老人。他头发花白，他看起来就像你那种典型的英国绅士，带着卷起的雨伞和他的洪堡帽等等。所以他们两人在某种滑稽的方式上都是漫画人物。然而，这些讨论、这些重大事件的后果，你绝对会，即使慕尼黑危机以何种方式结束，你都在向战争迈近一步。只是战争是下周发生，还是一年后发生。但慕尼
黑危机显然根本没有阻止战争的必然性。它只是加剧了它。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Do you think there are words that Chamberlain should have said, could have said that put more pressure on Hitler, intimidate Hitler more?</p>
        <p class="chinese">你认为张伯伦是否本可以，或者应该说些什么话来给希特勒施加更多压力，更威慑他？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Yeah, it’s a really tricky one. It’s such a difficult one because you’re always looking at it through… The enemy has a vote, and you don’t know what that vote is going to be, and you don’t know what it’s going to look like. There’s no question that the rest of Europe is cowled by the kind of impression of military might that the Germans have put out. They certainly fear they are stronger than they actually are. And then on the other hand, they’re also going, “Yeah, but Germany doesn’t have natural resources, doesn’t have access to the world’s oceans. It shouldn’t be able to win a war.” So they’re kind of contradicting themselves at the same time. So one minute they’re sort going, “Oh God, you don’t want to take on all those Nazis and all those swastikas and those automaton stormtroopers.” But on the other hand, they’re then saying, “But actually Germany doesn’t have much in its basket. It’s got actually quite a lot of weaknesses, and we should be to kind of able to prevail, blah, blah, blah. We’ll just impose an economic blockade, and then it’ll be stuffed.” And Britain is not ready to fight a war in 1948, but nor is Hitler, nor is Germany, so one is sort of striking out the other. But it’s very easy to say that in hindsight, but at the time, where people kind of digging trenches in Hyde Park in Central London and barrage balloons going up over London and children being evacuated from the cities and 92% of the population not wanting to go to war, you could see why he takes the course he does. I suppose that’s what I’m saying. I’m not saying it’s necessarily the right decision, but I think it’s an understandable decision.</p>
        <p class="chinese">是的，这确实是个棘手的问题。这非常困难，因为你总是透过……敌人有发言权，而你不知道那个发言会是什么，也不知道它会是什么样子。毫无疑问，欧洲其他国家都被德国所展示的那种军事力量的印象所震慑。他们肯定害怕德国比实际更强大。但另一方面，他们又在说：“是的，但德国没有自然资源，无法进入世界海洋。它不应该能赢得战争。”所以他们同时在自相矛盾。所以前一分钟他们还在说：“哦，天哪，你不想和所有那些纳粹、所有那些万字符以及那些机器人冲锋队员对抗。”但另一方面，他们又在说：“但实际上德国的实力并不强。它实际上有很多弱点，我们应该能够获胜，等等等等。我们只要实行经济封锁，它就完蛋了。”而英国在1948年还没有准备好打仗，但希特勒和德国也没有准备好，所以这有点像互相抵消。但事后诸葛亮很容易，但在当时，人们在伦敦市中心的海德公园挖战壕，防空气球在伦敦上空升起，孩子们从城市撤离，92%的人口不希望开战，你可以理解他为什么会选择那条路。我想这就是我想说的。我不是说那必然是正确的决定，但我认为那是一个可以理解的决定。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Oh, but what about even just on the human level? If I go into a room with a British gentleman versus going to a room with Trump, it feels like it’s so much easier to read and manipulate the British gentleman. Because Trump is like Trump-like characters. It seems like Hitler is similar, Churchill is similar. It’s like this guy can do anything. There’s something terrifying about- Unpredictability, yeah. Yeah, it feels like there’s something very predictable about Chamberlain.</p>
        <p class="chinese">哦，但即使只是在人性层面上呢？如果我走进一个有英国绅士的房间，和走进一个有特朗普的房间，感觉读懂和操纵英国绅士要容易得多。因为特朗普就像特朗普式的人物。感觉希特勒也类似，丘吉尔也类似。就像，这家伙什么都干得出来。有一种令人恐惧的——不可预测性，是的。是的，感觉张伯伦身上有一种非常可预测的东西。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Yes, I think that’s true. But also one has to take a step back and think about what Britain represents so, therefore, what Chamberlain represents in 1938. Britain has the largest empire the world has ever known in 1938. And so Britain was the number one nation in the world at that time, and it just was, and it’s so diminished by comparison today that it’s hard to imagine it. And I think one of the interesting things about the historiography, about the narrative of how we tell World War II is that so much of it has been dictated by the shift in power that took place subsequent to 1945. And when people were starting to write these sort of major narratives in the 1970s and ’80s and into the 1990s, is through a prism of a very, very different world. And so, one of the reasons why you have this narrative that Britain was a bit rubbish and hanging on the shirttails of the Americans and all the blood was spilt in eastern front and Germany had the best army in the world and was only defeated because Hitler was mad and blah, blah, blah, that kind of traditional narrative, that narrative emerges through the prism of what was going on in the 1970s and what was going on in the 1980s and the changing world, rather than looking at it through the prism of the late 1930s or early 1940s.</p>
        <p class="chinese">是的，我认为那是真的。但你也必须退一步，思考一下1938年英国代表着什么，因此，张伯伦代表着什么。1938年，英国拥有世界上最大的帝国。所以当时英国是世界第一大国，事实就是如此，与今天相比，它的地位已经大大削弱，以至于很难想象。我认为关于第二次世界大战史学，关于我们如何讲述二战的故事，一个有趣的地方在于，其中很大一部分是由1945年之后发生的权力转移所决定的。当人们在1970年代、80年代和90年代开始撰写这些宏大叙事时，是通过一个非常、非常不同的世界的棱镜。所以，你会有这种叙事，即英国有点差劲，依赖美国，所有的鲜血都洒在了东线，德国拥有世界上最好的军队，只是因为希特勒疯了才被打败，等等等等，那种传统叙事，那种叙事是通过1970年代和1980年代发生的事情以及不断变化的世界的棱镜出现的，而不是通过1930年代末或1940年代初的棱镜来看待它。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">So there is this moment of decision. What lesson do you take from that? When is the right time for appeasement, to negotiate, for diplomacy? And when is the right time for military strength, offensive, attacking, for military conflict? Where is that line?</p>
        <p class="chinese">所以，这是一个决定的时刻。你从中得到了什么教训？什么时候是绥靖、谈判、外交的正确时机？什么时候又是军事力量、进攻、攻击、军事冲突的正确时机？那条界限在哪里？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Well, I kind of think it probably was when it was. I mean- Poland. Yeah. Honestly, I’m not sure it would’ve been the right decision to go to war in 1938. I can’t predict because you can’t second-guess how things are going to play out because you just don’t know. But I’m not sure that Chamberlain made the wrong decision. I’m not saying he made the right decision. I’m being a bit wishy-washy about this. Yeah, but Churchill also appeases. I mean, he appeases Stalin all the time. So the idea that Churchill is this big strong man and never appeases, and he’s gung-ho over war, Churchill’s out of the government at that time. He recognizes that you can’t trust Hitler. He recognizes that Nazism is bad. But he, because he’s out of the government, he doesn’t have a window on exactly where Britain is at that particular time, in a way that Chamberlain does. I suppose what I’m saying is Chamberlain is better placed to make those decisions than Churchill is, which again, doesn’t mean that Chamberlain is right and Churchill is wrong. It’s just that’s a massive punt to go to war in 1938 when you still don’t have, you’ve got a handful of Spitfires, you’ve got a handful of Hurricanes, you haven’t got enough. Your air defense system isn’t properly sorted at this point. Your navy is strong, but what’s that kind of look like, I mean, if you do go to war? Because it’s not going to be army sweeping into Germany. It’s just it’s going to be accelerated industrialization for a year. So even if you go to war in 1938 over Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovakia will not be saved. France and Britain will not be going in and invading Germany. That is absolutely not going to happen. So what’s the point, I mean, if you’re not going to do that? Why didn’t you accelerate your rearmament thereafter, get your ducks in a row, and then you can consider it? I mean, after all, even in September 1939, they don’t really do anything. I mean, we talked about the kind of Saar Offensive, which isn’t really an offensive at all. It’s firing a one round of machine gun and scuttling back again. But I mean, they don’t even do that then. They’re still buying time in 1939, and Britain is only just about ready to take on the onslaught of the Luftwaffe in summer of 1940.</p>
        <p class="chinese">嗯，我有点觉得大概就是那个时候。我的意思是——波兰。是的。老实说，我不确定1938年开战是否是正确的决定。我无法预测，因为你无法事后诸葛亮，你根本不知道事情会如何发展。但我不确定张伯伦做出了错误的决定。我不是说他做出了正确的决定。我在这件事上有点含糊其辞。是的，但丘吉尔也绥靖。我的意思是，他一直绥靖斯大林。所以认为丘吉尔是一个强硬的人，从不绥靖，并且好战的想法，丘吉尔当时不在政府内。他认识到不能相信希特勒。他认识到纳粹主义是坏的。但他，因为他不在政府内，他对当时英国的确切情况没有一个窗口，而张伯伦有。我想我要说的是，张伯伦比丘吉尔更有能力做出那些决定，这再次，并不意味着张伯伦是对的，丘吉尔是错的。只是在1938年开战是一个巨大的赌博，那时你还没有，你只有少数的喷火战斗机，少数的飓风战斗机，你还不够。你的防空系统在那个时候还没有完全搞定。你的海军很强大，但那会是什么样子，我的意思是，如果你真的开战？因为它不会是军队横扫德国。它只会是加速工业化一年。所以即使你在1938年为捷克斯洛伐克开战，捷克斯洛伐克也救不了。法国和英国不会去入侵德国。那绝对不会发生。所以，我的意思是，如果你不那么做，又有什么意义呢？你为什么不在此后加速你的重整军备，把你的事情安排好，然后你再考虑？我的意思是，毕竟，即使在1939年9月，他们也真的什么都没做。我的意思是，我们谈到了萨尔攻势，那根本不是攻势。它只是开了一轮机枪，然后又溜了回来。但我的意思是，他们当时甚至都没那么做。他们在1939年仍然在争取时间，而英国到1940年夏天才勉强准备好应对德国空军的猛攻。</p>

        <h2>入侵波兰 (Invasion of Poland)</h2>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Well, nobody’s ready for war. No, and you always want more than you’ve got at any time, even when you’re winning. But like really not ready. Even like you mentioned with Barbarossa, Nazi Germany is really not ready. Except France. I swear, France- Fine. But come on, come on. When Nazi Germany invades Poland, I mean- Yeah, it’s terrible. It’s terrible because I also do think that had France gone in, in some force with some British troops as well, had they gone in, what would’ve happened is, is that would’ve, that easily could’ve brought down Hitler because most of his commanders are, his senior commanders are just thinking, “What the hell is going on? This is a catastrophe.” I mean, to a man. I mean, even Goring is thinking this is a terrible idea. They are absolutely not convinced. And when Hitler does his big talk to his… He asked all his senior commanders to come to the Berghof to brief them about invasion of Poland, it’s just after the Ribbentrop Molotov back to the 22nd of August. He calls them all to Berghof and says, “Come in mufti, come in civilian suits.” They all turn up, and he gives them this kind of huge great speech and says, “This is the moment, this is the time. This is what we’re going to do.” And they’re all going, “What? You’re kidding me. What, we’re going to Poland on the 26th of August, that’s the plan, like two days’ time? Where’s the plan?” The whole point is that they’re emerging and growing militarily, but they were supposed to have all these exercises where they’re coordinating ground forces, the Panzer spearhead with operations in the air with the Luftwaffe. None of that happens so Poland becomes the proving ground, and actually they discover that there’s lots of things that don’t work and lots of things that are wrong. But it’s flying in the face of all convention, military convention that he does this without any kind of warning. And even by the 1st of September where there’s been this kind of five-day delay at the last-minute negotiations. The last-minute negotiations are thrust upon Hitler by people like Goring and by Mussolini and the Italians going, “Oh my God, don’t do this. Don’t do this. There’s got to be a solution,” he was absolutely chomping at the bit. Well, in that case, from a dark militaristic perspective, his bet paid off. Well, except that it ended in ruins in May 1945 with the total collapse of Germany, so you could say the worst decision he ever made was going into Poland in September 1930. Depends the way you look at it, but I mean, yes, it’s successful in that Poland is overrun in 18 days.</p>
        <p class="chinese">嗯，没人准备好战争。不，而且你总是在任何时候都想要比你拥有的更多，即使你在赢。但就像真的没准备好。即使就像你提到的巴巴罗萨行动，纳粹德国也真的没准备好。除了法国。我发誓，法国——好吧。但拜托，拜托。当纳粹德国入侵波兰时，我的意思是——是的，那很可怕。那很可怕，因为我也确实认为，如果法国当时派了一些部队，还有一些英国军队也一起进去，如果他们进去了，会发生什么呢，那就会，那很容易就能推翻希特勒，因为他的大多数指挥官，他的高级指挥官们，都在想：“这到底是怎么回事？这是一场灾难。”我的意思是，每个人都这么想。我的意思是，甚至戈林都觉得这是个糟糕的主意。他们绝对不相信。当希特勒向他的……他要求他所有的高级指挥官都到贝格霍夫，向他们简报入侵波兰的情况，那是在8月22日里宾特洛甫-莫洛托夫协议之后。他把他们都叫到贝格霍夫，说：“穿便装来，穿便服来。”他们都来了，然后他给他们发表了这种长篇大论的演讲，说：“就是现在，就是这个时候。这就是我们要做的。”他们都想：“什么？你开玩笑吧。什么，我们8月26日就要去波兰，这是计划，就像两天后？计划在哪？”关键在于，他们正在军事上崛起和壮大，但他们本应进行所有这些演习，协调地面部队、装甲矛头与德国空军的空中行动。这些都没有发生，所以波兰成了试验场，实际上他们发现有很多东西行不通，有很多东西是错的。但他这样做，完全无视所有惯例，军事惯例，没有任何警告。甚至到了9月1日，由于最后一刻的谈判，已经有了这种五天的延迟。最后一刻的谈判是像戈林和墨索里尼以及意大利人强加给希特勒的，他们说：“哦，我的天，别这么做。别这么做。必须有个解决方案，”他绝对是摩拳擦掌。嗯，在那种情况下，从一个黑暗的军国主义角度来看，他的赌注成功了。嗯，除了它在1945年5月以德国的彻底崩溃而告终，所以你可以说，他做过的最糟糕的决定是在1930年9月进入波兰。这取决于你怎么看，但我的意思是，是的，它在18天内占领了波兰，是成功的。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">And there’s so many counterfactuals here.</p>
        <p class="chinese">这里有太多的反事实假设了。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">But I mean if you were to say to Hitler on the 30th of April as he’s sort of taking out the pistol from his holster on his sofa in the Fuhrerbank and going, “Yeah, so, Adolf, 1st of September 1939, still backing yourself on that one?” I mean, he might have a different view. The guy’s insane and full of blunder so he probably would’ve said, “Yeah, do it all over again.” Yeah, I’m sure he would’ve done as well. Conquest Poland was not a mistake. Soviet Union was not a mistake. No. It’s just some of the- Other people. “I was let down by people not being strong enough.” Yeah, the Prussian generals are all- Yeah, of course. That’s exactly what he’d say. “It wasn’t my fault.” He might have quietly done some different decisions about Barbarossa. Maybe the timing would be different. Maybe that all out central for us, rather than kind of splitting into three. Yeah. Yep.</p>
        <p class="chinese">但我的意思是，如果你在4月30日对希特勒说，当他在元首地堡的沙发上从枪套里掏出手枪，然后说：“是的，那么，阿道夫，1939年9月1日，你还支持自己当时的决定吗？”我的意思是，他可能会有不同的看法。那家伙疯了，而且错误百出，所以他可能会说：“是的，再来一次。”是的，我肯定他也会那么做。征服波兰不是错误。苏联也不是错误。不。只是其中一些——其他人。“我被那些不够坚强的人辜负了。”是的，普鲁士的将军们都是——是的，当然。他肯定会那么说。“那不是我的错。”他可能会悄悄地对巴巴罗萨行动做出一些不同的决定。也许时机会不同。也许是全力以赴的中央攻势，而不是分成三路。是的。是的。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">But he was very sure, it seems like, maybe you can correct me, that Britain and France would still carry on with appeasement even after he invaded Poland.</p>
        <p class="chinese">但他似乎非常肯定，也许你可以纠正我，即使在他入侵波兰之后，英国和法国仍会继续采取绥靖政策。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Absolutely. He was completely convinced by it. There was clearly a sort of 10 to 15% level of doubt, “But what the heck, I’m going to do it anyway.” He’d ratcheted himself up into such a lava of kind of, “This is the moment. I have to do it now. This is fate. I’m 50, and I could be taken out by an assassin’s bullet. I’ve got this important life work that I’ve got to do. We’ve got to get on with it now. There could be no more delay. This is my mission. This is our mission of the German people, and the German people have got the will and the spirit to be able to pull it off.” Or “I was wrong, and, therefore, we don’t deserve to be a Thousand-Year Reich. We don’t deserve to be the master race, black or white.”</p>
        <p class="chinese">绝对如此。他对此深信不疑。显然，他有大约10%到15%的疑虑，但他说：“管他呢，我还是要这么干。”他把自己推向了这样一个炽热的境地，仿佛在说：“就是现在。我必须现在就做。这是命运。我50岁了，随时可能被刺客的子弹干掉。我还有这项重要的人生事业要做。我们必须现在就行动。不能再拖延了。这是我的使命。这是我们德意志民族的使命，而德意志民族有意志和精神去完成它。”或者“我错了，因此，我们不配成为千年帝国。我们不配成为优等民族，非黑即白。”</p>

        <h2>莫洛托夫-里宾特洛甫条约 (Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact)</h2>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">So can you tell the story of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939? So they make an agreement, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and that leads us, just like you were mentioning, in a matter of days, how compact everything is. It’s just really, really fascinating how crooked-</p>
        <p class="chinese">那么，你能讲述一下1939年《莫洛托夫-里宾特洛甫条约》的故事吗？他们达成了一项协议，纳粹德国和苏联，这导致了，就像你提到的，在几天之内，一切都变得如此紧凑。这真的、真的很迷人，如此曲折——</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">It’s a beautiful summer in Europe, summer of 1939. It’s one of these glorious summers that sort of never rains. It’s just sunshine, sunny day after sunny day. It’s like that sort of golden summer of 1914 as well, where sky always seems to be blue, fluffy, white clouds, everyone sort of, you know, but this sort of the storm clouds of war, to use that cliche, are kind of brewing. The Russians have reached out to Britain and France and said, “Come on over, let’s negotiate. Let’s see what we can do,” and there is just no stomach for that at all. I mean, if ever there is, I think, a mistake that’s Britain and France should’ve been a bit more into realpolitiks than they were. It’s such an opportunity to ensure that, to snooker the Third Reich, and they don’t take it. Because in many ways they see the westward spread of communism in exactly the same way that the Nazis see the threat of the westward spread of communism as something that’s every bit as repellent as Nazism, and they don’t want to be getting into bed with these guys. Of course, they have to kind of change tack on that one in summer of 1941 in very quick order, and that’s the whole point about Churchill appeasing Stalin. I mean, it’s all very well people saying, “Well, Churchill wouldn’t have appeased Hitler in the 1930s,” but he does appease. He appeases all the time, and they miss that opportunity. And the French and British delegation is third-tier commanders, generals going over. Yeah, it was a shit show. I mean, yeah, excuse my French, but I mean, it’s a nonsense that they’re not ready for it. They’re not prepared. The British guy doesn’t have any authority. The whole thing’s a complete joke. It’s never going to get anywhere.</p>
        <p class="chinese">那是1939年欧洲一个美丽的夏天。那是那种光辉灿烂、几乎不下雨的夏天。只有阳光，一天又一天都是晴天。就像1914年那个黄金夏天一样，天空似乎总是蓝色的，飘着蓬松的白云，每个人都……你知道，但战争的乌云，用这个陈词滥调来说，正在酝酿。俄国人已经联系了英国和法国，说：“过来吧，我们来谈判。看看我们能做些什么，”但他们根本没有那个意愿。我的意思是，如果说英国和法国犯了一个错误，我认为，他们本应该更懂得现实政治。那是一个确保……挫败第三帝国的绝佳机会，但他们没有抓住。因为在很多方面，他们看待共产主义向西扩张，与纳粹看待共产主义向西扩张的威胁完全一样，认为那与纳粹主义一样令人厌恶，他们不想和这些人搅在一起。当然，他们在1941年夏天不得不很快改变策略，这就是丘吉尔绥靖斯大林的全部意义所在。我的意思是，人们说：“嗯，丘吉尔在1930年代不会绥靖希特勒，”这说得很好，但他确实绥靖。他一直在绥靖，而他们错过了那个机会。法国和英国的代表团是三流的指挥官，将军们过去了。是的，那是一场烂摊子。我的意思是，是的，请原谅我的粗话，但我的意思是，他们没有准备好，这很荒谬。他们没有准备好。那个英国人没有任何权力。整件事完全是个笑话。它永远不会有任何结果。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">You tell the story of this quite beautifully, actually. Again, it’s such a human story. I mean, it seems like the Stalin and the Soviet- They’ve already made up their mind. But- Well, I don’t they have. I think what they- Wait, wait, wait. I mean, you described quite well that they value in-person meeting. Yes. So Chamberlain should have just gone to Moscow. Yeah, get on a plane. Maybe it’s a simplistic notion, but that could’ve changed the trajectory of human history right there.</p>
        <p class="chinese">你把这个故事讲得相当美，实际上。再次，这是一个如此人性化的故事。我的意思是，看起来斯大林和苏联——他们已经下定决心了。但是——嗯，我不认为他们已经下定了。我认为他们——等等，等等，等等。我的意思是，你描述得很好，他们重视面对面的会议。是的。所以张伯伦本应该直接去莫斯科。是的，上飞机。也许这是一个简单的想法，但这可能就在那里改变了人类历史的轨迹。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">I really think it could’ve done. I think that’s much more grievous mistake than the Munich. Well, yes, and because we, humans, we like to interact, and you like to see people in three dimensions, and I’m sure that’s why you always, quite rightly, insist on doing your podcast face-to-face. Because you want to get the cut of someone’s jib, and you want to be able to see them, and you want to see the intonation and the expression and the whites of their eyes and all that kind of stuff. And that just does make a difference, of course, because we’re fundamentally animals, and we want to be sizing people up. And it’s much easier to do that when you’re a few feet away from each other than it is on a video screen or through the prism of someone else. … and military conflict is the extreme version of that. You can construct these narratives that they’re not human, that they’re evil, that they’re… You can construct communist ideology, all these… You can project onto them the worst possible version of a human. But when you meet them, you’re like, “Oh.” They’re all just a person. Well, it’s the world’s great tragedy that it’s only a few people that want to go to war, and the vast majority want to live happily contented lives getting on with their neighbors. I mean, it has been ever thus. It’s just it is those few that kind ruin it for everybody else. But anyway, to go back to Leningrad, back in August 1939, they go half-cocked. They’re disrespectful to Soviet Union as a result of that. It gets nowhere. Had they been able to put on a really, really firm offer there and then to the Soviet Union, Soviet Union would’ve probably come in. I mean, the big thing is, is that the Soviet Union said, “This is a big stumbling block.” The Soviet Union said, “Yeah, but we want to be able to march through Poland if we get threatened by Germany.” But the British and French just smell a massive rat there. They’re basically saying if they agree to that, what they fear is that Soviet Union will just march into Poland and go, “Yeah, but you said we could,” and take it, which they unquestionably would’ve done, but it would’ve stopped the World War, probably. They’re not willing to appease anybody by that stage, that’s the point. They did, but you have there’s a bottom line, which is Poland, so it’s changed. That’s the point. But anyway, the bottom line is they don’t, there is a reluctance on the part of French and the British to negotiate with the Soviet Union because they’re communists, don’t like them, don’t trust them, worry about what they’re going to do with Poland, are they’re going to be jumping out of the fire into the kind of water, and it doesn’t come off. And as a consequence of that, Soviet Union continue to pursue more hardly, more and more vociferously the opportunities that the Germans are offering, which is the split of Poland. Because Soviet Union wants that part of Poland back in its own sphere of influence, and it doesn’t want to go to war just yet. Yep. No, he believed it in the same way that Hitler believed it, that it was a cynical kind of convenient bit of realpolitik for now. I mean, I think Soviet Union was as determined to get rid of the Nazis as the Nazis were determined to get rid of the Soviet Union. I think whoever fired first was not decided at that point, but I do think that from the moment that Hitler takes power in 1933, a conflict between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany is inevitable.</p>
        <p class="chinese">我真的认为那本可以做到。我认为那比慕尼黑会议是更严重的错误。嗯，是的，因为我们人类，我们喜欢互动，你喜欢看到三维的人，我肯定这就是为什么你总是，非常正确地，坚持面对面做你的播客。因为你想了解一个人的性格，你想能看到他们，你想看到语调、表情、他们眼中的神情等等。那当然会产生影响，因为我们本质上是动物，我们想衡量一个人。当你离对方几英尺远时，比在视频屏幕上或通过别人的棱镜，更容易做到这一点。……而军事冲突是那种情况的极端版本。你可以构建这些叙事，说他们不是人，他们是邪恶的，他们是……你可以构建共产主义意识形态，所有这些……你可以把最坏的人类版本投射到他们身上。但当你见到他们时，你会说：“哦。”他们都只是一个人。嗯，这是世界的巨大悲剧，只有少数人想发动战争，而绝大多数人只想和他们的邻居和睦相处，过着幸福满足的生活。我的意思是，向来如此。只是那些少数人毁了其他所有人的生活。但无论如何，回到列宁格勒，回到1939年8月，他们半心半意地去了。因此，他们对苏联不尊重。那没有任何结果。如果他们当时能够向苏联提出一个非常、非常坚定的提议，苏联很可能就会加入。我的意思是，最重要的是，苏联说：“这是一个巨大的绊脚石。”苏联说：“是的，但我们希望在受到德国威胁时能够穿越波兰。”但英国和法国只是嗅到了巨大的阴谋。他们基本上是说，如果他们同意，他们担心的是苏联会直接进入波兰，然后说：“是的，但你们说我们可以，”然后占领它，这是他们毫无疑问会做的，但这可能会阻止世界大战，大概吧。到那个阶段，他们不愿意绥靖任何人，这就是重点。他们确实绥靖过，但你有一个底线，那就是波兰，所以情况变了。这就是重点。但无论如何，底线是他们没有，法国和英国方面不愿意与苏联谈判，因为他们是共产主义者，不喜欢他们，不信任他们，担心他们会对波兰做什么，他们会不会是从火坑里跳进水里，结果没成。因此，苏联继续更强硬地，越来越大声地寻求德国提供的机会，也就是瓜分波兰。因为苏联想让那部分波兰回到自己的势力范围，而且它还不想马上开战。是的。不，他相信它的方式和希特勒相信它的一样，那是一种犬儒式的，目前方便的现实政治。我的意思是，我认为苏联消灭纳粹的决心和纳粹消灭苏联的决心是一样的。我认为当时谁先开枪还没有决定，但我确实认为，从1933年希特勒掌权的那一刻起，苏联和纳粹德国之间的冲突是不可避免的。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">So either direction, you think it’s inevitable. Yeah. I think, yeah, there’s a huge amount of evidence for that. Stalin probably wanted it, what, in ’42, ’43? Yeah. Something like that? Yeah. And they’re doing exercises and stuff and building out, but he’s not ready yet because he knows he’s done the purges and he’s got to get his armed forces back into shape and all the rest of it. So they have this incredibly cynical agreement, but at that point, Hitler’s hands are untied. He no longer has to worry about the threat from the Soviet Union. He’s got carte blanche to go into Poland, and he doesn’t believe that France and Britain are going to go to war over Poland. He’s wrong about that, obviously. But France and Britain, despite going to war with him, still do nothing. So he’s got away with it.</p>
        <p class="chinese">所以无论哪个方向，你都认为这是不可避免的。是的。我认为，是的，有大量的证据支持这一点。斯大林可能想在42、43年发动战争，对吧？是的。差不多是那样？是的。他们正在进行演习之类的，并且在建设，但他还没有准备好，因为他知道他进行了大清洗，他必须让他的武装力量恢复状态等等。所以他们达成了这个极其犬儒的协议，但在那个时候，希特勒的手脚被解开了。他不再需要担心来自苏联的威胁。他可以随心所欲地进入波兰，而且他不相信法国和英国会为波兰开战。显然，他在这件事上错了。但法国和英国，尽管与他开战，却仍然无所作为。所以他得逞了。</p>

        <h2>温斯顿·丘吉尔 (Winston Churchill)</h2>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Who was Churchill, and how did Churchill come to power at this moment?</p>
        <p class="chinese">丘吉尔是谁，他又是如何在这个时刻上台的？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Well, Churchill is this absolutely towering figure in British politics. He’s first minister in the naughties of the 20th century and the first years of the 20th century. First of the liberals, then of the conservatives. He’s a former Chancellor of the Exchequer. He’s a towering figure, but he’s been in the wilderness because he’s out of favor with the Stanley Baldwin government. He’s out of favor with Chamberlain, but he is this towering figure, and he has been very outspoken as a backbencher, which basically means you’re not a minister, you’re not in the cabinet, you’re just an ordinary member of parliament. But obviously you are an ordinary member of parliament, but you’re also an ordinary member of parliament who has had ministries of state and who is this towering figure. So he’s listened to in a way that other backbenchers aren’t. And he has been saying, “We need to stand up to the dictators. We need to do this. We need to rearm more heavily,” and blah, blah, blah. So when war is declared, he’s brought back into the admiralty in charge of the Navy, which is Britain’s senior service, and suddenly he’s there. And what happens is Britain doesn’t really do anything. It’s very difficult working with France because France is so politically fractured that they can’t make any decisions. When you can’t make any decisions, you are just impotent. And so Churchill first mentions going into Norway mining the leads. So the idea is that you’re making life very difficult for the Germans to get iron ore out of Sweden. Their main source of iron ore is up in the northern part of Sweden in the Arctic Circle, and then goes on a railway through the northern tip of Norway and then gets shipped down the west coast of Norway into Germany, into the Baltic. So Churchill suggests, in September 1939, why don’t we mine the leads? Which the leads are these passageways out of the fjords in the north into the North Sea. Why don’t we mine those and stop the Germans from taking this? And everyone goes, “Well, yeah, that’s quite a good idea.” But they can’t decide, and the French are nervous that if they do that, the Germans would retaliate in bomb France and all this kind of stuff. So no decision is made until April 19, 1940. They go up to start mining the leads on exactly the same day that the Germans invade Denmark and Norway, and so they’re caught off guard. And at that moment, really it’s seen as a failure of Chamberlain’s government. And there is a mounting realization that no matter how good he was or competent he was as a peacetime Prime Minister, he’s not a wartime Prime Minister. He’s not served in the armed forces himself. He doesn’t really understand it. It needs a different set of hands. And his government falls on the 9th of May. It becomes inevitable that he’s going to have to resign. And the obvious person to take his place is Lord Halifax, who is in the House of Lords, but you could still be a Prime Minister. And he is, without question, the most respected politician in the country. He’s the former Viceroy of India. He’s seen as an incredibly safe pair of hands, man of resolute sound judgment, et cetera, et cetera. But he doesn’t want to take it. He feels physically ill at the prospect, doesn’t want this responsibility. He is also not really a military man. He’s got a slightly withered hand, which has prevented him from doing military service. And he just blanches at this moment, and that really leaves only one other figure that could possibly take on this position, and that’s Churchill. So when Chamberlain resigns on the 9th of May and Halifax says, “It’s not for me,” the only person who’s going to step into that position is Churchill, and he becomes Prime Minister, and he accepts it gladly. He feels like it is his mission in life. This is his moment come of the outcome of the man. But he comes with a huge amount of baggage. He’s known as a man who drinks too much, whose judgment hasn’t always been great. He was Chancellor during the time of the General Strike in 1926. He backed Edward VIII over the monarchy crisis when the King wanted to marry Wallis Simpson, the Catholic divorcee, et cetera, et cetera. So his judgment has been brought into question. He is the man who came up with the idea of the Gallipoli campaign, which was an ignominious failure, blah, blah, blah. So there are issues over him. He is seen as a hothead and a man who doesn’t have the sound judgment of Halifax. So the jury is very much out. And I think, again, it’s one of those things where you have to look at this through the prism of what people were thinking in May 1940. Yes, he was considered a towering politician, but he is seen also as a loose cannon and by no means the right person in this hour of darkness. And it is coincidental that the 10th of May 1940, when he takes over as Prime Minister, becomes Prime Minister, not through an election, but by default of a new nationalist government. So no longer a conservative government, but a nationalist cross-party coalition government for the duration of the war, which includes members of the Liberal Party and also the Labour Party as well as conservatives, that it is by no means certain that he is going to be able to deliver the goods. And it is also coincidentally the same day that the Germans launched Case Yellow, Operation Yellow, the invasion of the low countries in France. So these are tumultuous events, to put it mildly. And it is also the case that only a couple of weeks before, Paul Reynaud has taken over his Prime Minister of yet another coalition government in France from Daladier. So political turmoil is very much the watchword at this time for the Western democracies, just at the moment that the Germans are making their hammer strike into the West.</p>
        <p class="chinese">嗯，丘吉尔是英国政坛绝对的泰山北斗。他在20世纪初和20世纪头几年担任过首席部长。先是自由党，后是保守党。他曾是财政大臣。他是一位重量级人物，但当时他处于政治荒野，因为他不受斯坦利·鲍德温政府的待见，也不受张伯伦的待见，但他就是这样一位重量级人物，而且作为一名后座议员——这基本上意味着你不是部长，不在内阁，只是一个普通的国会议员——他一直非常直言不讳。但显然，你是一个普通的国会议员，但你也是一个曾经担任过国务部长、并且是这样一位重量级人物的普通国会议员。所以他的话会以其他后座议员所没有的方式被倾听。他一直在说：“我们需要对抗独裁者。我们需要这样做。我们需要更大规模地重整军备，”等等等等。所以当战争爆发时，他被召回海军部，负责海军，那是英国的高级军种，突然他就出现在那里了。发生的事情是，英国实际上什么也没做。与法国合作非常困难，因为法国在政治上如此分裂，他们无法做出任何决定。当你无法做出任何决定时，你就是无能为力的。所以丘吉尔首先提到要去挪威布雷。想法是，你让德国人从瑞典获取铁矿石变得非常困难。他们的主要铁矿石来源在瑞典北部的北极圈内，然后通过挪威北端的铁路运输，再沿着挪威西海岸运往德国，进入波罗的海。所以丘吉尔在1939年9月建议，我们为什么不在航道上布雷呢？航道就是那些从北方的峡湾通往北海的通道。我们为什么不在那里布雷，阻止德国人拿走这些？大家都说：“嗯，是的，这是个好主意。”但他们无法决定，法国人担心如果他们那么做，德国人会报复，轰炸法国等等。所以直到1940年4月19日才做出决定。他们在德国入侵丹麦和挪威的同一天去布雷，所以他们措手不及。在那个时刻，这真的被看作是张伯伦政府的失败。人们越来越认识到，无论他作为和平时期的首相有多么出色或能干，他都不是一位战时首相。他自己没有在军队服役过。他并不真正了解。这需要一个不同的人来处理。他的政府在5月9日倒台。他辞职变得不可避免。接替他的明显人选是哈利法克斯勋爵，他在上议院，但你仍然可以担任首相。毫无疑问，他是该国最受尊敬的政治家。他是前印度总督。他被视为一双极其稳妥的手，一个果断、判断力健全的人，等等等等。但他不想接任。他对这个前景感到身体不适，不想要这个责任。他也不是真正的军人。他有一只略微萎缩的手，这使他无法服兵役。他在这一刻退缩了，这真的只留下了一个可能接任这个职位的人，那就是丘吉尔。所以当张伯伦在5月9日辞职，哈利法克斯说：“这不适合我，”唯一一个将要接任这个职位的人就是丘吉尔，他成为了首相，并且欣然接受。他觉得这是他一生的使命。这是他这个人的命运时刻。但他带来了大量的包袱。他以嗜酒著称，他的判断力也并非总是很好。他在1926年大罢工期间是财政大臣。他在君主制危机中支持了爱德华八世，当时国王想娶天主教徒离异者沃利斯·辛普森，等等等等。所以他的判断力受到了质疑。他是提出加里波利战役想法的人，那是一场不光彩的失败，等等等等。所以他身上存在问题。他被视为一个鲁莽的人，一个没有哈利法克斯那样健全判断力的人。所以结论远未确定。我想，这又是那种你必须通过1940年5月人们的想法的棱镜来看待的事情。是的，他被认为是一位杰出的政治家，但他也同时被视为一个不可控的因素，在这个黑暗时刻绝非合适人选。巧合的是，1940年5月10日，当他接任首相时——不是通过选举，而是通过一个新的民族政府的默认成为首相。所以不再是保守党政府，而是一个在战争期间的民族主义跨党派联合政府，其中包括自由党和工党的成员以及保守党——绝不确定他能否胜任。同样巧合的是，同一天，德国人发动了“黄色方案”（Case Yellow），入侵低地国家和法国。所以，温和地说，这些都是动荡的事件。同样的情况是，仅仅几周前，保罗·雷诺刚刚从达拉第手中接任法国又一个联合政府的总理。所以，政治动荡是此时西方民主国家的关键词，恰逢德国人向西方发起猛烈攻击。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">This might be a good moment to bring up this idea that has been circulating recently brought up by Darryl Cooper, who hyperbolically stated that Churchill was the quote, chief villain of the Second World War. To give a good faith interpretation of that, I believe he meant that Churchill forced Hitler to escalate the expansion of Nazi Germany beyond Poland into a global war. So Churchill is the one that turned this narrow war, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Poland, into a global one. Is that accurate?</p>
        <p class="chinese">这可能是个好时机，来谈谈最近由达里尔·库珀（Darryl Cooper）提出的一个观点，他夸张地宣称丘吉尔是“第二次世界大战的主要反派”。为了善意地解读这句话，我相信他的意思是丘吉尔迫使希特勒将纳粹德国的扩张从波兰升级为一场全球战争。所以是丘吉尔将这场狭隘的战争——捷克斯洛伐克、奥地利、波兰——变成了一场全球战争。这准确吗？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">No, I don’t think it is, not least because the decisions over Poland were made by Chamberlain’s government when Churchill was out of government. So Churchill wasn’t even involved in a decision-making process at the time. No, I don’t think so. Again, I go back to Britain’s position in the world in 1939. If you say, “We are going to defend the sovereignty of Poland,” and then you don’t, that looks really bad globally. Britain’s prestige would plummet. It would lead all sorts of problems. You are saying that you are giving carte blanche to dictators to just run amok and take whatever territory they want. You are risking a future upheaval of the global order away from democracies into the hands of dictators. In the West people believe in democracy and believe in advancement of freedoms of people. To echo the words of Roosevelt in August 1941, they’re responding to a world free of want and fear. Now obviously, there are still some issues with the form that democracy takes in the 1930s. It’s not democratic for everyone. Try saying that if you are in Nigeria or India or whatever, or if you’re in the black Southern states of the United States. But the aspirations are there. And I think that’s an important distinction. And I think by saying that Churchill is the chief warmonger of the Second World War, I think, is ludicrous. It’s the same thing about the bombing. The detractors of strategic air campaign always go, “Yeah, but Germans had the Holocaust, but weren’t the Allies just as bad just killing all those civilians?’ It’s like, no, because the moment Hitler stopped the war, the bombing would stop. The moment the war stopped in Hitler’s favor, the killing would continue and be accelerated.</p>
        <p class="chinese">不，我不这么认为，至少因为关于波兰的决定是在丘吉尔不在政府时由张伯伦政府做出的。所以丘吉尔当时甚至没有参与决策过程。不，我不这么认为。再次，我回到1939年英国在世界上的地位。如果你说：“我们将捍卫波兰的主权，”然后你没有做到，那在全球范围内看起来非常糟糕。英国的威望会一落千丈。这会引发各种问题。你等于是在说，你给了独裁者们一张空白支票，让他们为所欲为，占领他们想要的任何领土。你是在冒着未来全球秩序从民主国家转向独裁者手中的风险。在西方，人们相信民主，相信人民自由的进步。呼应罗斯福在1941年8月的话，他们是在回应一个免于匮乏和恐惧的世界。当然，1930年代民主的形式仍然存在一些问题。它对每个人来说都不是民主的。如果你在尼日利亚或印度或其他地方，或者如果你在美国南部的黑人州，你试试这么说。但愿景是存在的。我认为这是一个重要的区别。我认为说丘吉尔是第二次世界大战的主要战争贩子，我认为是荒谬的。这和关于轰炸的事情一样。战略空袭的批评者总是说：“是的，但德国人有大屠杀，但盟军不也一样坏，杀害了所有那些平民吗？”这就像，不，因为希特勒一停止战争，轰炸就会停止。而一旦战争以希特勒的胜利而停止，杀戮将继续并加速。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">So the thing you mentioned initially is the idealist perspective of well, Britain can’t allow this warmonger to break all these pacts and be undemocratic, murder a large number of people and do conquests of territory. That’s idealistic. But if we look at the realist perspective, what decisions would minimize the amount of suffering on the continent in the next 50 years? So one of the arguments that he’s making, I happen to disagree with it, to put it mildly, is that Churchill increased the amount of suffering, so Churchill’s presence and decisions. So we’re not talking about idealistic perspective, we’re talking about a realistic. The reality of the war of Stalin, of Hitler, of Churchill, of France and FDR, did Churchill drag Hitler into a world war? Did he force Hitler to invade the Soviet Union? Did he force Hitler to then attack Britain?</p>
        <p class="chinese">所以你最初提到的，是理想主义者的观点，即英国不能允许这个战争贩子打破所有这些条约，实行不民主，屠杀大量人民，并进行领土征服。那是理想主义的。但如果我们从现实主义者的角度看，什么样的决定能在未来50年里最大限度地减少欧洲大陆的苦难？所以他提出的一个论点，我碰巧不同意，温和地说，是丘吉尔增加了苦难，所以是丘吉尔的存在和决定。所以我们不是在谈论理想主义的观点，我们是在谈论现实的。斯大林、希特勒、丘吉尔、法国和罗斯福的战争的现实，丘吉尔是否把希特勒拖入了一场世界大战？他是否迫使希特勒入侵苏联？他是否然后迫使希特勒攻击英国？</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">Well, no, because Hitler was always going to invade the Soviet Union unless the Soviet Union invaded Germany first. So that was always going to happen. No one asked Hitler to invade the low countries and Norway and Denmark and attack Britain. He does that, of course, because he’s not given a free hand in Poland. But there’s no question that Hitler would have also wanted to subdue France or certainly turn France from a democracy into a totalitarian state as well. I’m absolutely certain about that.</p>
        <p class="chinese">嗯，不，因为希特勒总是要入侵苏联的，除非苏联先入侵德国。所以那总是会发生的。没人要求希特勒入侵低地国家、挪威和丹麦，然后攻击英国。他那么做，当然，是因为他在波兰没有得到自由行动的权利。但毫无疑问，希特勒也想征服法国，或者至少把法国从一个民主国家变成一个极权国家。我对此绝对确定。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">So I think there’s pretty definitive evidence, it’s obvious from everything he’s said, from everything he’s written, from everything everywhere, that he was going to invade the Soviet Union no matter what. And France? Most likely yes also.</p>
        <p class="chinese">所以我认为有相当确凿的证据，从他所说的一切、他所写的一切、从所有地方的一切来看，他无论如何都会入侵苏联。那法国呢？很可能也是的。</p>
        <h3>James Holland:</h3>
        <p class="english">He would have done a deal with Britain. Britain could have coexisted. So actually, there is a possible reality, I don’t know, maybe you can correct me on this, where Hitler basically takes all of Europe except Britain. Yes, but then he would have got so strong that he would have then turned on Britain as well, because the fear is that if you let him do this, then he gets greedy. He wants the next one, then he wants the next one, then he wants the next one, and then he wants to take over the whole world. That is the fear of the British. That is the fear of the Americans. That’s the fear of President Roosevelt. We haven’t even touched on this yet, but he has a very difficult case on his hands because he has come into power also in January of 1933 as President of the United States on an isolationist ticket with a retrenching, with a step away from the European old order. It’s time for the Europeans to stand on their own. It all sounds very familiar right now. And suddenly he’s got to do this gargantuan political turn and prepare the nation for war because he also fears, like Churchill fears, like Chamberlain feared as well, that Hitler’s designs are not purely on Eastern Europe and the Lebensraum there, but would get ever bigger. And I don’t doubt that they’re right. I think if he’d prevailed in the Soviet Union, he’d have always wanted more, because his whole concept is the master race.</p>
        <p class="chinese">他本可以和英国达成协议。英国本可以共存。所以实际上，有一种可能的现实，我不知道，也许你可以纠正我，就是希特勒基本上占领了除英国以外的整个欧洲。是的，但那样他就会变得如此强大，以至于他也会转而攻击英国，因为人们担心，如果你让他这么做，他就会变得贪婪。他想要下一个，然后是下一个，然后是下一个，然后他想占领整个世界。这是英国人的恐惧。这是美国人的恐惧。那是罗斯福总统的恐惧。我们还没谈到这个，但他手头有一个非常棘手的案子，因为他也是在1933年1月上台，作为美国总统，他的竞选纲领是孤立主义，要收缩，要摆脱欧洲的旧秩序。欧洲人是时候自力更生了。这一切听起来现在很熟悉。突然之间，他不得不进行这个巨大的政治转向，让国家为战争做好准备，因为他也害怕，就像丘吉尔害怕，就像张伯伦也害怕一样，希特勒的野心并不仅仅局限于东欧和那里的“生存空间”，而是会越来越大。我毫不怀疑他们是对的。我想如果他在苏联获胜，他会一直想要更多，因为他的整个概念就是“优等民族”。</p>
        <h3>Lex Fridman:</h3>
        <p class="english">Yeah, I think it should be said if we measure human suffering, if there was not Britain on the other side, if it was not a two-front war, that the chances of Hitler succeeding in the Soviet Union is much </p>
