    <h2>
        <span class="title-en">Xi Jinping and Mao Zedong</span>
        <span class="title-zh">习近平与毛泽东</span>
    </h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p class="speaker">Lex Fridman</p>
        <p class="lang-en">You’ve compared Xi Jinping and Mao Zedong in the past. What are the parallels between the two leaders, and where do they differ? Xi Jinping, of course, is the current leader of China for the past 12 years, and Mao Zedong was the communist leader of China from 1949 to 1976. So what are the commonalities, what are the differences? </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">您过去曾将习近平和毛泽东进行比较。这两位领导人之间有何相似之处，又有何不同？当然，习近平是过去12年中国的现任领导人，而毛泽东是1949年至1976年中国的共产主义领导人。那么，他们的共同点和不同点是什么？ </p>
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p class="speaker">Jeffrey Wasserstrom</p>
        <p class="lang-en">So the biggest commonality of them is that they’re both the subject of personality cults, and that Mao was the center of a very intensely felt one from 1949 to 1976.  And when he died, there was tremendous outpouring of grief, even among people who had objectively suffered enormously because of his policies.  Xi Jinping is the first leader in China since him who has had a sustained personality cult of the kind where if you walk into a bookstore in China, the first thing you see are books by him, collections of his speeches.  And when Mao was alive, you might’ve thought that’s sort of what happened with Communist Party leaders in China.  But after Mao’s death, there was such an effort to not have that kind of personality cult that there was a tendency to not publish the speeches of a leader until they were done being in power.  I was first in China in 1986, and you could go for days without being intensely aware of who was in charge of the party.  You would know, but his face wasn’t everywhere, the newspaper wasn’t dominated with stories about him, and quotations from his words and things like that.  So with Xi Jinping, you’ve had a throwback to that period in Communist Party rule, which seemed as though it might be a part of the past. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">他们最大的共同点是，两人都是个人崇拜的对象。毛泽东在1949年至1976年间是一个非常强烈的个人崇拜的中心。  当他去世时，即使是那些因其政策而遭受巨大苦难的人们，也表现出极大的悲痛。  习近平是自他以来第一位在中国拥有持续性个人崇拜的领导人，当你走进中国的书店，首先看到的就是他的著作和演讲集。  毛泽东在世时，你可能会认为中国共产党的领导人都是如此。  但在毛泽东去世后，党内曾努力避免这种个人崇拜，倾向于在领导人卸任后才出版其演讲稿。  我1986年第一次到中国时，你可能好几天都不会强烈地意识到谁是党的领导人。  你会知道是谁，但他的面孔不会无处不在，报纸也不会充斥着关于他的报道和语录。  因此，习近平的出现，仿佛让共产党统治回到了那个似乎已经成为过去的时代。 </p>
        <p class="lang-en">Xi Jinping is very orderly, is very concerned with kind of stability and predictability.  So you can see them as very, very different that way. And Mao also liked to stir things up like that, people on the streets clamoring.  So Xi Jinping, even though he has a personality cult, it’s not manifesting itself.  He doesn’t like the idea of people on the streets in anything that can’t be controlled.  They’re also different, and this fits with this orderliness that Xi Jinping talks positively about Confucius and Confucian traditions in China.  And Confucian traditions are based on kind of stable hierarchies for the most part, and sort of clear categories of superior and inferior, whereas Mao like things to be turned upside down.  He thought of Confucianism as a feudal way of thought that it held China back.  So you can come up with things that they’re similar and you can come up with things where they’re really opposites.  But they both clearly did want to see China under rule by the Communist Party, and that’s been a continuity, and that connects them to the leaders in between them too as well. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">习近平非常注重秩序，非常关心稳定性和可预测性。  从这个角度看，他们二人非常不同。毛泽东则喜欢煽动群众，让人们走上街头呐喊。  所以习近平虽然有个人崇拜，但表现形式不同。  他不喜欢任何无法控制的街头活动。  他们的另一个不同之处在于，习近平积极评价儒家和儒家传统，这与他注重秩序的特点相符。  儒家传统主要基于稳定的等级制度，以及清晰的上下级关系，而毛泽东则喜欢颠覆这一切。  他认为儒家思想是阻碍中国发展的封建思想。  因此，你可以找出他们的相似之处，也可以找出他们截然相反的地方。  但他们都明确希望中国由共产党统治，这是一个持续的共同点，也使他们与中间的领导人联系在了一起。 </p>

    <h2>
        <span class="title-en">Confucius</span>
        <span class="title-zh">儒家思想</span>
    </h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p class="speaker">Lex Fridman</p>
        <p class="lang-en">So there’s some degree, as you said, that Xi Jinping espouses the ideas of Communism and the ideas of Confucianism. So let’s go all the way back. You wrote that in order to understand the China of today, we have to study its past. So the China of today celebrates ideas of Confucius, a Chinese philosopher who lived 2,500 years ago. Can you tell me about the ideas of Confucius? </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">所以如您所说，习近平在一定程度上同时信奉共产主义和儒家思想。让我们追溯到源头。您曾写道，要了解今天的中国，就必须研究其过去。  今天的中国推崇孔子的思想，他是一位生活在2500年前的中国哲学家。  您能介绍一下孔子的思想吗？ </p>
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p class="speaker">Jeffrey Wasserstrom</p>
        <p class="lang-en">First of all, we don’t know that much about the historic Confucius.  He’s around the same time as figures like Socrates. And like with Socrates, we get a lot of what we know about him or think we know about him from what his followers said and things that were attributed to him and dialogues that were written afterwards.  Confucius lived in a time when there were these warring kingdoms in a territory that later became China.  But what he said was that there had been this period of great order in the past that the lines between inferior and superior were clear, and there was a kind of synergy between superior and inferior that kept everything ticking along really nicely.  He thought that hierarchical relationships were a good thing, and that the trick was that both sides in a hierarchical relationship owed something to the other. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">首先，我们对历史上的孔子其人知之甚少。  他与苏格拉底等人物生活在同一时代。和苏格拉底一样，我们对他的了解大多来自于其追随者的记述、后人归于他的言论以及后世撰写的对话录。  孔子生活在一个后来成为中国的领土上，当时群雄割据，战火纷飞。  但他认为，过去曾有一个秩序井然的时代，上下级关系明晰，并且上下级之间存在一种协同效应，使一切都运转得非常好。  他认为等级关系是好事，关键在于等级关系中的双方都对彼此负有责任。 </p>
        <p class="lang-en">So the father and son relationship was a key one.  The father deserved respect from the son, but owed the son care and benevolence, and things would be fine as long as both sides in a relationship held up their end.  And he had a whole series of these relationships. The husband to the wife was, again, an unequal one of the husband being superior to the wife, but him owing the wife care and her owing him deference.  And he had the same notion that then the emperor to the ministers were… These were all parallels, and there were no egalitarian relationships in Confucianism.  Even something that in the West we often think of as a kind of quintessentially egalitarian relationship between brothers. In the Chinese tradition of Confucianism, there was only older brother and younger brother. Brotherhood was not an egalitarian relationship. It was one where the older brother took care of the younger brother and the younger brother showed respect for the older brother. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">父子关系就是一个关键。  父亲应得到儿子的尊敬，但同时要给予儿子关爱和仁慈，只要双方都尽到自己的责任，一切就会和谐。  他提出了一系列这样的关系。夫妻关系同样是不平等的，丈夫优于妻子，但丈夫要关爱妻子，妻子则要顺从丈夫。  他将这种观念延伸到君臣关系……这些都是平行的，儒家思想中没有平等的关系。  即使是兄弟关系，这种在西方通常被视为典型的平等关系，在中国的儒家传统中，也只有兄与弟之分。兄弟关系并非平等的，而是兄长照顾弟弟，弟弟尊敬兄长。 </p>
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p class="speaker">Lex Fridman</p>
        <p class="lang-en">So stable hierarchy was at the core of everything in society. It permeated everything including politics. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">所以，稳定的等级制度是社会一切的核心。它渗透到包括政治在内的所有领域。 </p>
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p class="speaker">Jeffrey Wasserstrom</p>
        <p class="lang-en">Yeah. And there was even a sense that it connected the natural world to the supernatural world.  So the emperor was to heaven this kind of non-personified deity like the emperor was to the minister.  So all of this had these relationships. So the emperor was the son of heaven.  And for Confucius, he said, so we should study the texts, we should study how the sages of old behaved, that society was becoming corrupted and was going away from that sort of purity of the sages when the relationships were all in order.  So Confucianism was a kind of conservative or even backward looking.  It wasn’t arguing for progress, it was arguing for reclaiming a pure golden age in the past.  So it was also a kind of conservative. So in all kinds of ways, it’s irreconcilable to many things about Marxism and communism, which is all about struggle and all about actually a progressive view of history moving from one stage to the next. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">是的。甚至有一种观点认为，它连接了自然世界与超自然世界。  皇帝之于天（一种非人格化的神祇），就像皇帝之于大臣。  这一切都存在着这样的关系。所以皇帝是“天子”。  对于孔子来说，他主张我们应该研究经典，学习古代圣人的行为方式，因为他认为当时的社会正在堕落，偏离了圣人时代那种关系井然有序的纯粹状态。  因此，儒家思想是一种保守甚至倒退的学说。  它不主张进步，而是主张回归过去纯粹的黄金时代。  所以它也是一种保守主义。从各方面来看，它与马克思主义和共产主义的许多理念都无法调和，因为后者强调斗争，并持有一种历史从一个阶段向下一个阶段发展的进步史观。 </p>
    </div>

    <h2>
        <span class="title-en">Education</span>
        <span class="title-zh">教育</span>
    </h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p class="speaker">Lex Fridman</p>
        <p class="lang-en">But if you can linger on Confucius for a little bit, you write that one of the most famous statements of Confucianism is the belief that, quote, “People are pretty much alike at birth, but become differentiated via learning.” So this sets the tradition that China places a high value on education and on meritocracy. Can you speak to this Confucius’s idea of education, and how much does it permeate to the China of today? </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">如果我们能再多谈谈孔子，您写道，儒家最著名的论断之一是“性相近，习相远”。这奠定了中国高度重视教育和精英政治的传统。您能谈谈孔子的教育理念，以及它在多大程度上渗透到今天的中国吗？ </p>
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p class="speaker">Jeffrey Wasserstrom</p>
        <p class="lang-en">Sure. So there’s an optimism to this, there’s an optimism in the sense of a ability that people can be good.  And when exposed to exemplary figures from the past, they’ll want to be like those exemplary figures.  So it was a form of education through kind of emulation of models and study of past figures and past texts that were exemplary.  And it did have this idea, a relatively positive view of human nature and the sort of changeability of humans through education.  And I think that shows through in all kinds of things, even the fact that while there were lots of killings by the Chinese Communist Party and other groups, there was often an idea that people could be remolded potentially.  And China was one of the few places where they didn’t kill the last emperor.  The last emperor, the idea was that he could become… anybody could be kind of turned into a citizen of this or a subject of this, a good member of this polity through the kind of education, often it was a very kind of forceful form of education, but I think that’s a carryover from the Confucian times.  And over time, this Confucian idea led to the creation of one of the early great civil service exams, an idea that bureaucracy should be run, not by people who were born into the right families, but ones who had shown their ability to master these fairly intensive kind of exams. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">当然。这种观点中有一种乐观主义，即相信人可以通过学习向善。  当人们接触到过去的榜样人物时，他们会渴望成为那样的人。  所以这是一种通过模仿榜样、学习过去杰出人物和典籍来进行的教育。  它确实持有一种对人性的相对积极的看法，认为人可以通过教育来改变。  我认为这一点体现在很多方面，即使中国共产党和其他团体曾进行过大量杀戮，但通常也存在一种观念，即人是可以被改造的。  中国是少数几个没有处死末代皇帝的地方之一。  当时的想法是，末代皇帝可以……任何人都可以通过教育——通常是一种非常强制性的教育——被改造成这个政体的合格公民或臣民。我认为这是儒家时代的遗风。  随着时间的推移，这种儒家思想促成了早期伟大的科举制度的建立，即官僚体系应该由那些通过了高强度考试、证明了自己能力的人来管理，而不是由出身名门的人来管理。 </p>

    <h2>
        <span class="title-en">Tiananmen Square</span>
        <span class="title-zh">天安门广场</span>
    </h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p class="speaker">Lex Fridman</p>
        <p class="lang-en">Since you mentioned Tiananmen Square, you have studied a lot of student protests throughout Chinese history, throughout history in general, what happened in Tiananmen Square? </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">既然您提到了天安门广场，您研究了中国历史上乃至整个历史上的许多学生抗议活动，那么天安门广场到底发生了什么？ </p>
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p class="speaker">Jeffrey Wasserstrom</p>
        <p class="lang-en">So in 1989, this massive movement took place, the story of it’s largely suppressed within China and largely misunderstood in other places in part because it happened around the same time that communism was unraveling and ending in the former Soviet Bloc.  So I think it’s often conflated with what was going on there.  And so I think one of the key things to know about the protests in 1989 was that they were an effort to get the Communist Party in China to do a better job of living up to its own stated ideals, and to try to support the trend within the party toward a kind of liberalizing and opening up form that had taken shape after Mao’s death.  In a sense, the student generation of ’89, and I was there in ’86 when there were some sort of warm-up protests, there was a kind of frustration with what they felt was a half-assed version of what they were talking about, that the government was saying, the party was saying, we believe in reforming and opening up, we need to liberalize, we need to give people more control of their fate.  And the students felt that this was being done more effectively in the economic realm than in the political realm, and that there were a lot of sort of partial gestures that suggested the party needed to be pressed to really, really move in that direction. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">1989年，发生了一场大规模的运动。这件事在中国国内基本上被压制，在其他地方则被广泛误解，部分原因是它恰好与前苏联集团共产主义解体和终结的时期重合。  所以，人们常常把它与那里的情况混为一谈。  我认为，关于1989年抗议活动，一个关键点在于，它是一场试图让中国共产党更好地践行其自身宣称的理想的努力，并试图支持党内自毛泽东去世后形成的那种自由化和开放的趋势。  从某种意义上说，89年的学生一代（我86年在中国时曾经历过一些预热式的抗议）对他们所认为的“半吊子”改革感到失望。政府和党都在说，我们相信改革开放，我们需要自由化，需要给人民更多的命运掌控权。  但学生们觉得，这在经济领域比在政治领域做得更有效，而且有很多半心半意的姿态表明，需要给党施加压力，才能真正朝着那个方向前进。 </p>
        <p class="lang-en">Then in 1989, the protest restart, and there are a variety of reasons why they can restart.  Students are thinking about doing something in 1989. It’s a very resonant year, 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.  People are thinking about that. But more importantly, it’s the 70th anniversary of the biggest student movement in Chinese history, the May Fourth Movement of 1919. And the May Fourth Movement had helped lay the groundwork for the Chinese Communist Party.  It was an anti-imperialist movement, but it was also a movement against bad government. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">然后在1989年，抗议活动重新开始，其重启有多种原因。  学生们在考虑在1989年有所行动。这一年意义非凡，是法国大革命200周年。  人们都在思考这件事。但更重要的是，这一年是中国历史上最大规模的学生运动——1919年五四运动的70周年。而五四运动为中国共产党的成立奠定了基础。  它是一场反帝国主义的运动，同时也是一场反对恶劣政府的运动。 </p>
        <p class="lang-en">A leader, Hu Yaobang, who was associated with the more kind of reformist, more liberalizing group within the Chinese Communist Party, he had been stripped of a very high office, demoted after partly taking a fairly light stance toward the ’86, ’87 protests.  He had been sort of Deng Xiaoping’s potential successor, and he dies unexpectedly.  And the students take advantage of the opening of there having to be commemorations of his death.  And they put up posters that basically say the wrong people are dying.  This is in April of ’89.  And the government tries to sort of get the protest to stop quickly, and they use the sort of same technique of they issue an editorial in People’s Daily that says, “This is creating chaos,” which is a code term for take us back to the Culture Revolution.  And this time the students say, “No, we’re just trying to show our patriotism. We believe that there’s too much corruption and nepotism. There’s not enough support for the more liberalizing wing within the party.” And so they keep up the protests. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">一位与中共党内更具改革派、更自由化团体有关的领导人胡耀邦，因对86、87年的抗议活动采取了较为温和的立场，被免去了高级职务并降职。  他曾被视为邓小平的潜在接班人，却意外去世。  学生们利用了必须为他举行悼念活动的机会。  他们张贴海报，基本上是说“该死的人没死”。  这是在89年4月。  政府试图迅速平息抗议，并使用了与之前类似的手段，在《人民日报》发表社论，称“这是在制造动乱”，这是一个暗指“让我们回到文化大革命”的代号。  但这一次，学生们说：“不，我们只是想表达我们的爱国主义。我们认为腐败和裙带关系太严重了。党内更自由化的一翼没有得到足够的支持。”于是他们继续抗议。 </p>
        <p class="lang-en">Once there are labor activists joining the movement, then troops are called in. And there’s a massacre near Tiananmen Square on the middle of the night of June 3rd and early on June 4th.  And the army just moves in and begins behaving very much like an army of occupation, which is something that People’s Liberation Army is supposed to be the one that saves China from foreign aggression, and they’re acting like an invading force. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">一旦有劳工活动家加入运动，军队就被召集进来。6月3日深夜至6月4日凌晨，天安门广场附近发生了一场屠杀。  军队进入后，其行为非常像一支占领军。而人民解放军本应是保卫中国免受外国侵略的军队，他们却表现得像一支入侵部队。 </p>

        <p class="lang-en">It’s an amazing symbol. He’s on this boulevard near the square with this long line of tanks, and it’s unquestionably this act of incredible bravery.  And there’s some interesting things about it, some that are forgotten. One is that in the end he climbs up on the tank and the tank swerves. It doesn’t run him over. And the Chinese Communist Party initially showed video of this and said, “Look, the Western press is talking about how vicious we were, but look at the restraint. Look at this. He wasn’t mowed down.”  And they tried this whole story with Tiananmen initially of saying, “Look, the students were out of control. Everybody should remember what happened during the Cultural Revolution, and the army showed restraint.”  But by selective use of footage, the Communist Party could say, “Look. Actually look at this. The heroes, the martyrs, were these soldiers.”  And they try, for the first months after it, to try to get this narrative to stick.  They talk about Tiananmen a lot. They show images of the tank man. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">这是一个惊人的象征。他站在广场附近的这条大道上，面对着一长列坦克，这无疑是令人难以置信的勇敢行为。  关于这件事有一些有趣但被遗忘的细节。其中之一是，他最终爬上了坦克，坦克转弯避开了他，并没有碾过他。  中国共产党最初播放了这段视频，并说：“看，西方媒体说我们有多么残暴，但看看我们的克制。看看这个，他没有被碾压。”  他们最初试图用这种叙事来解释天安门事件，声称“学生失控了，大家应该记住文革期间发生的事情，军队表现出了克制。”  通过选择性地使用录像，共产党可以说：“看，实际上，英雄和烈士是这些士兵。”  在事件发生后的头几个月里，他们试图让这种说法深入人心。  他们大量谈论天安门，并展示坦克人的影像。 </p>
        <p class="lang-en">The problem with it is that lots and lots of people around Beijing had seen what happened and knew that in fact, there’d first been the firing on unarmed civilians with automatic weapons.  So that story just didn’t work.  And then I think the claim had to be made to try to suppress discussion of the event and particularly to repress that visual imagery that was that image of the man in front of the line of tanks.  Whatever the tanks did to him or not, the main takeaway from it would be this idea that there were lines of tanks in a city. The image was of the government as having lost the mandate to rule, and they really didn’t want to have that image out there in the world. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">问题在于，北京周围有许许多多的人亲眼目睹了所发生的一切，他们知道事实是，军队首先用自动武器向手无寸铁的平民开火。  所以那个故事根本行不通。  然后，我认为，他们不得不压制对该事件的讨论，特别是压制那个男人站在坦克前的视觉形象。  无论坦克是否伤害了他，这个画面传达的主要信息是城市里出现了成排的坦克。这个形象表明政府已经失去了统治的合法性，他们绝不希望这个形象在世界上流传。 </p>
        <p class="lang-en">So nobody knows what happened to the tank man? </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">所以没人知道那个坦克人后来怎么样了？ </p>
        <p class="lang-en">No. I assume he was killed. I assume he was just disappeared. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">不知道。我推测他被杀了。我推测他就是被消失了。 </p>

        <p class="lang-en">There’s a lot of censorship. One of my favorite books about Chinese censorship, Margaret Roberts, where she talks about there are three different ways that the government can control the stories.  And she says there’s fear, which is this direct censorship thing, like banning things. But there’s also friction. She has three Fs, fear, friction, and flooding, and she says they’re all important, and I think this is true not just of China, but in other settings too.  So what friction means is you just make it harder for people to get answers or get information that you don’t want them to get.  Even though you know that some people will get it, you just make it that the easiest way, the first answer you’ll get through a search.  So a lot of tech-savvy or globally minded, tapped-in Chinese people will use a VPN to jump over the firewall.  But it’s work. The internet moves slower. You have to keep updating your VPN.  So you just create friction so that, okay, some people will find this out. And then flooding.  You just fill the airwaves and the media with versions of the stories that you want the people to believe. So all those exist and in operation, and I think the fear is the easiest side to say what’s blocked. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">审查非常多。我最喜欢的一本关于中国审查制度的书是玛格丽特·罗伯茨（Margaret Roberts）写的，她在书中谈到政府有三种控制信息的方式。  她说有“恐惧”（fear），也就是直接的审查，比如禁止某些东西。但还有“摩擦”（friction）。她提出了三个F：恐惧、摩擦和“淹没”（flooding），她认为这三者都非常重要。我认为这不仅适用于中国，也适用于其他环境。  “摩擦”的意思是，你让人们更难获得你不希望他们得到的答案或信息。  即使你知道有些人还是会得到，你只是让最简单的方式——通过搜索得到的第一个答案——不是那个信息。  很多技术娴熟、有全球视野、信息灵通的中国人会用VPN翻墙。  但这很麻烦。网速会变慢，你还得不断更新你的VPN。  所以你只是制造摩擦，让一些人最终还是会找到信息。然后是“淹没”。  你用你希望人们相信的故事版本填满广播和媒体。这几种方式都存在并运作着，我认为“恐惧”是最容易指出的被屏蔽的部分。 </p>
        <p class="lang-en">You can read all sorts of things in China about totalitarianism. You can read Hannah Arendt’s book on totalitarianism.  You’re not supposed to be able to read that in a somewhat totalitarian state or a dictatorial state of anything, but it’s not specifically about China.  And so censorship is most restrictive when it’s things that are actually about China.  Things about leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, there’s intense kind of censorship of that, and certain events in that way.  You can buy 1984 in a Chinese bookstore. You’ve been able to since 1985. Again, it’s not about China. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">在中国，你可以读到各种关于极权主义的东西。你可以读到汉娜·阿伦特的关于极权主义的书。  在一个某种程度上的极权或独裁国家，你本不应该能读到这些，但因为它不是专门针对中国的。  所以，当内容实际关乎中国时，审查才是最严格的。  关于中国共产党领导人的事情，以及某些特定事件，会受到非常严格的审查。  你可以在中国的书店买到《1984》。自1985年以来一直如此。同样，因为它不是关于中国的。 </p>

        <p class="lang-en">I’ll frame it in a way that I think does lead into talking about Hong Kong, because I think these are connected issues.  In 1984, the year, not the book this time, that’s when a deal was struck basically, between London and Beijing over what would happen to Hong Kong.  And the deal was about transferring sovereignty of all of Hong Kong, all these parts, to the People’s Republic of China.  And I carefully say transfer sovereignty, not give it back to the People’s Republic of China, because it never belonged to the People’s Republic of China.  And the deal that was struck was that the London side wanted to do something to protect what was going to happen to the people there.  But in this negotiation, something was come up with, called One Country, Two Systems.  And Hong Kong would become part of the People’s Republic of China in diplomatic terms. It would have its own system for 50 years, was the idea, from 1997 until 2047. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">我会从一个引向香港讨论的角度来阐述，因为我认为这两个问题是相互关联的。  1984年——这次是年份，不是书——伦敦和北京就香港的未来达成了一项基本协议。  该协议是将整个香港的主权移交给中华人民共和国。  我谨慎地使用“移交主权”而不是“归还”，因为香港从未属于过中华人民共和国。  达成的协议中，伦敦方面希望为当地人民的未来提供某种保障。  在这次谈判中，一个名为“一国两制”的方案应运而生。  根据这一构想，香港在外交上将成为中华人民共和国的一部分，但在1997年至2047年的50年间，将保留自己的制度。 </p>
        <p class="lang-en">The reason why Taiwan is relevant to all this is, in 1984, as they were discussing this, the Chinese Communist Party said, and will come up with this arrangement and people in Taiwan should pay attention to it, because it could provide a model for what could happen with them being absorbed into the people’s Republic of China.  So the idea was Beijing said, “Hey, people in Taiwan, watch what happens to Hong Kong after 1997, and think about it as a model for what could happen with you,” saying, watch how smoothly it will go.  Over time, people in Hong Kong started saying, well wait, Beijing keeps sort of nibbling away, chipping away at these things that make us separate.  Hong Kong activists put up a banner saying, “Hey, Taiwan, look at Hong Kong. Taiwan beware. Hong Kong’s today. It could be Taiwan’s tomorrow.” So basically spinning the one country, two systems argument, and saying, “Yeah, Taiwan. You should watch what happens here.” </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">台湾之所以与此相关，是因为在1984年讨论这一安排时，中国共产党表示，台湾人民应该关注这一模式，因为它可能为台湾被中华人民共和国吸收提供一个范例。  当时的想法是，北京方面说：“台湾同胞们，看看1997年后香港会发生什么，把它当作你们未来的一个样板，”意思是，看看一切会进行得多顺利。  随着时间的推移，香港人开始觉得北京在不断蚕食和削弱那些使他们与众不同的东西。  香港的活动人士打出横幅，上面写着：“嘿，台湾，看看香港。台湾要当心。今日香港，明日台湾。”这基本上是反过来利用“一国两制”的论点，说：“是的，台湾，你们应该看看这里发生了什么。” </p>
        <p class="lang-en">And yet in part because of what’s happened to places like Hong Kong, there’s a fiercer, a stronger sense of Taiwan identity now than there was at an earlier point.  And less parties that are more willing to try to negotiate some kind of tighter connection with the PRC, are often doing badly in elections there because of this mood. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">然而，部分原因在于香港等地的遭遇，如今台湾的身份认同感比以往任何时候都更加强烈。  那些更愿意与中华人民共和国谈判建立更紧密联系的政党，常常因为这种情绪而在选举中表现不佳。 </p>

        <p class="lang-en">2047 is 50 years from the 1997 handover that you were talking about with Hong Kong.  On top of that, 2049 is a hundred years from Mao taking power.  It feels like at that moment, China could take Taiwan, because it does seem that there’s a kind of value for history in China, and they take these days very seriously.  On the other hand, as you have studied, there is some tensions, and displeasure, and protests, some of the biggest in human history in Hong Kong.  And so put all of that together, and so many possible trajectories of human history could happen here. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">2047年是您提到的香港1997年移交50周年的节点。  此外，2049年是毛泽东掌权一百周年。  感觉在那个时刻，中国可能会拿下台湾，因为中国似乎对历史有种特殊的看重，他们对这些纪念日非常认真。  另一方面，正如您所研究的，香港存在着紧张、不满和抗议，其中一些是人类历史上规模最大的抗议活动。  将所有这些因素放在一起，人类历史在这里可能会有许多种可能的发展轨迹。 </p>

        <p class="lang-en">The issue was an extradition law that would have people, potentially, who committed crimes in Hong Kong being tried for them if the mainland wanted them on the mainland.  Now, the difference, they’re really different court systems. Hong Kong never had democracy under the British, but it did have a stronger rule of law and more independent courts.  Courts that sometimes decided things that went the other way than what the government wanted. And the mainland doesn’t have that kind of court system. 98, 99% conviction rate.  In Hong Kong if you’re arrested, even for before 2020, if you were arrested, even under a politically-related charge, you were out on bail and giving interviews with the press. On the mainland, that didn’t happen. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">当时的问题是一项引渡法案，该法案可能导致在香港犯罪的人，如果大陆方面要求，会被送到大陆受审。  关键区别在于，两地的法院系统完全不同。在英国统治下，香港从未有过民主，但它确实有更强的法治和更独立的法院。  这些法院有时会做出与政府意愿相悖的判决。而大陆没有那样的法院系统，定罪率高达98%、99%。  在2020年之前，如果你在香港被捕，即使是因政治相关指控，你也可以获得保释并接受媒体采访。在大陆，这种情况不会发生。 </p>

        <p class="lang-zh">我之所以这么说，是因为在最大规模的抗议活动中，有100万到200万人参加。  而香港总人口是750万。所以你想想这意味着什么，这个规模是巨大的。 </p>

        <p class="lang-en">It’s such such a hard moment to be imagining these things. I’ve long wanted to see a return of China to this path toward a more … I wasn’t one of the people who imagined that there would be this convergence of China’s emergence into evolution into a liberal capitalist kind of country.  But I’d love to see a return to that more kind of tolerance of diversity within China, variations within China, of more space for civil society.  And it’s a hard time to even imagine that, because Hong Kong kind of represented that place that was somehow within.  I think it’s really extraordinary how much leeway was given to Hong Kong for a period there.  That was really special. No Communist Party-run country had ever had a city within it that had as free a press as Hong Kong had then, as much tolerance for protests. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">现在是这样一个时刻，很难去想象这些事情。我一直希望能看到中国重返一条更……我不是那种想象中国会演变成一个自由资本主义国家的人。  但我希望能看到中国回归到那种对内部多样性和差异性更加宽容、为公民社会提供更多空间的道路上。  而现在甚至很难想象这一点，因为香港在某种程度上就代表了那样一个地方。  我认为，在那个时期，香港所获得的自由空间是相当非凡的。  那真的很特别。没有一个共产党执政的国家，其境内曾有过一个像当时的香港那样拥有自由媒体和对示威活动高度容忍的城市。 </p>
        <p class="lang-en">There’s a New Zealand-based China specialist, Geremie Barmé, who talks about the other China, which can exist within China, physical China, or elsewhere.  Which is this equally attached to Chinese traditions, but thinking of those traditions as including not just Confucianism but Taoism, not just hierarchy, but also openness to cosmopolitanism. Not just nationalism, but cosmopolitanism.  And I think there are some elements of that, that even in failure, the Hong Kong movements, the Hong Kong protests of the 2020s were a last flourishing of that.  China has multiple cultural strands, multiple traditions that people can tap into.  And it’s something richer and more admirable, I think, than this narrowed down version. </p>
        <p class="lang-zh">新西兰有一位中国问题专家白杰明（Geremie Barmé），他谈到“另一个中国”，这个中国可以存在于实体中国之内，也可以存在于别处。  这个“另一个中国”同样依附于中国传统，但认为这些传统不仅包括儒家，也包括道家；不仅有等级制度，也对世界主义持开放态度；不仅是民族主义，也是世界主义。  我认为，即便失败了，香港的运动，即2020年代的抗议，也带有这些元素，是这种精神最后的绽放。  中国有多种文化脉络和传统可供人们发掘。  我认为，这比当前这种被窄化了的版本要丰富和可敬得多。 </p>
