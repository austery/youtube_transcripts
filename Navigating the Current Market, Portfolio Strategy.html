            <h2 id="section-1">FOMC Meeting Recap: A Stagflationary Outlook / FOMC会议回顾：滞胀前景</h2>
            <div class="lang-en">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> I want to start by talking about the FOMC meeting that just happened yesterday. Looking at the dots, they actually downticked their GDP projection for 2025 from 1.7% to 1.4%, expecting lower growth. For the unemployment rate, they're looking at 4.5% by year-end, up from 4.4%. And in PCE inflation, an increase from 2.7% to 3.0%. So we're seeing growth being downticked, inflation ticking up higher, but at the same time, we didn't see any changes on their projections for Fed funds rate cutting. The majority still ticked in for two cuts this year. What was interesting, however, is that the number of FOMC members projecting no cuts by the end of this year increased from four to seven. Joseph, what was your read?</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> What was most interesting to me was the dot plot forecast. It seems like the Fed is a bit more downbeat on the economy, revising down growth, but also seemed a little bit stagflationary, right? You're revising up inflation and revising up unemployment. The Fed has been saying for the past few months that they are basically just going to be late. Powell has been telling us that there are so many things happening in the economy—changes in immigration policy, fiscal policy, regulatory policy, and trade policy—and he doesn't know what's going to happen, so he's just going to wait. That's a little bit different than how he usually acts. Now he's committing to being late. What that tells me is that he's really not going to do anything until we see the unemployment rate tick up, and it's been trending higher.</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> The only incremental change for 2025 was that three people went from one cut to no cut, and one person went from two cuts to one cut. So that's hawkish. And the nearest cut is not priced until September anyway. Someone did ask about the immigration issues, and he noted that this dynamic where you can have a more stable unemployment rate for the reasons of a shrinking labor force... he basically acknowledged this as being okay. On many accounts, very hawkish. I think you really need to see market weakness for them to move.</p>
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> My take is that by just staying flat, the Fed is still creating an even more restrictive monetary policy stance. Even though their intention is just to not do anything, by doing nothing, they're actually being hawkish. As inflation comes down, real rates go higher. It feels like they are finding reasons to be hawkish.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lang-zh">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> 我想从昨天刚刚结束的<span class="tooltip">FOMC（联邦公开市场委员会）<span class="tooltiptext">FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)：美联储内部负责制定货币政策的委员会。</span></span>会议开始谈起。从<span class="tooltip">点阵图（dot plot）<span class="tooltiptext">点阵图(Dot Plot)：FOMC成员对未来联邦基金利率的匿名预测图表。</span></span>来看，他们实际上将2025年的GDP增长预期从1.7%下调至1.4%。失业率预期从4.4%上调至年底的4.5%。而<span class="tooltip">PCE（个人消费支出）<span class="tooltiptext">PCE(个人消费支出)通胀指数：美联储首选的通货膨胀衡量指标。</span></span>通胀预期从2.7%上调至3.0%。所以我们看到增长预期下调，通胀预期上调，但与此同时，他们对联邦基金利率的降息预测没有变化。大多数成员仍然预测今年会有两次降息。然而有趣的是，预测今年底前不降息的FOMC成员从四位增加到了七位。Joseph，你的解读是什么？</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> 对我来说，最有趣的就是点阵图的预测。看起来美联储对经济前景有点悲观，下调了增长预期，但同时又显得有些滞胀，对吧？你上调了通胀和失业率预期。过去几个月，美联储一直在说他们基本上会“行动迟缓”。鲍威尔告诉我们，经济中发生了太多事情——移民政策、财政政策、监管政策和贸易政策的变化——他不知道会发生什么，所以他只会等待。这和他通常的行为方式有些不同。现在他承诺要行动迟缓。这告诉我，在失业率上升之前，他真的不会采取任何行动，而失业率一直在上升。</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> 2025年唯一的增量变化是，三个人从一次降息变为不降息，一个人从两次降息变为一次降息。所以这是鹰派的。而且最近的降息也要等到九月份才被市场定价。有人问到了移民问题，他指出，劳动力萎缩导致失业率更稳定，他基本上认为这是可以接受的。在很多方面，这都非常鹰派。我认为他们需要看到市场走弱才会采取行动。</p>
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> 我的看法是，美联储仅仅保持利率不变，实际上仍在制造一种更具限制性的货币政策立场。尽管他们的意图是什么都不做，但通过无所作为，他们实际上是鹰派的。随着通胀下降，实际利率会上升。感觉他们总是在找理由保持鹰派立场。</p>

            <h2 id="section-2">The SLR Exemption: Unpacking the Fed's Regulatory Shift / SLR豁免：解读美联储的监管转变</h2>
            <div class="lang-en">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> Something else that's happening next week is that the Fed is planning to have a meeting about the <span class="tooltip">supplementary leverage ratio (SLR)<span class="tooltiptext">SLR (Supplementary Leverage Ratio): A U.S. bank regulation requiring large banks to hold a minimum level of capital against their total assets, regardless of risk.</span></span>. They're looking at implementing some sort of an SLR exemption for Treasuries or a meaningful loosening of those levels. Joseph, can you explain that whole dynamic? Why are they pursuing this deregulation approach?</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> Taking a step back, in 2008 we had a huge crisis, so regulators decided to regulate banks in a big way. They imposed a whole bunch of costs on banks based on the size and composition of their balance sheet. For example, risk-weighted assets. They also added a backstop, the leverage ratio, where banks have to hold capital against an asset regardless of its riskiness. This SLR has been a real hindrance for banks that traffic in very safe assets like Treasuries because it imposes costs on trading these assets that don't really make sense. It's been widely thought that this has been harming the markets. Now, as the Treasury market continues to grow, it's becoming more of a highlight for regulators. They don't want the market to break. They're also thinking that if they were to decrease the cost of banks holding these Treasuries, maybe they would buy more, which would put downward pressure on interest rates. That seems to be the impetus for this change.</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> Most of the analysis I've seen around the SLR evaluates it in the context of what occurred during COVID when they last made this exemption. That's a difficult comparison because at the time, we were potentially in deflation, and the Fed had forward guidance stating no cuts. The repercussions of that resulted in the 2023 banking crisis. So I think there's probably PTSD on the banking side that restricts them and limits how effective SLR is.</p>
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> It feels like they're trying to grease the runway for when this huge rebuild of the <span class="tooltip">Treasury General Account (TGA)<span class="tooltiptext">TGA (Treasury General Account): The U.S. Treasury's primary checking account, used for most government payments and collections. Its balance affects market liquidity.</span></span> comes forth. You see this dynamic of trying to get these deregulations to happen, and furthermore, we're starting to see them try to really pass the GENIUS Act bill. The fastest-growing buyers of Treasury debt right now are stablecoins like Tether.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lang-zh">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> 下周将发生的另一件事是，美联储计划召开一次关于<span class="tooltip">补充杠杆率（SLR）<span class="tooltiptext">补充杠杆率(SLR)：美国的一项银行监管规定，要求大型银行持有最低水平的资本以应对其总资产，无论风险如何。</span></span>的会议。他们正在考虑对国债实施某种形式的SLR豁免，或大幅放松这些水平。Joseph，你能解释一下这整个动态吗？他们为什么会采取这种放松监管的方式？</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> 回顾一下，2008年我们经历了一场巨大的危机，所以监管机构决定大力监管银行。他们根据银行资产负债表的规模和构成，对银行施加了大量成本。例如，风险加权资产。他们还增加了一个后备措施，即杠杆率，要求银行无论资产风险如何，都必须持有相应的资本。这个SLR对于交易像国债这样非常安全的资产的银行来说，一直是个真正的障碍，因为它对交易这些资产施加了不合理的成本。人们普遍认为这损害了市场。现在，随着国债市场持续增长，这成了监管机构更关注的焦点。他们不希望市场崩溃。他们还认为，如果降低银行持有国债的成本，也许银行会购买更多，从而对利率产生下行压力。这似乎是这次变革的推动力。</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> 我看到的大多数关于SLR的分析，都是在新冠疫情期间上次豁免的背景下进行的。这是一个困难的比较，因为当时我们可能处于通缩状态，而且美联储有明确的前瞻指引，表示不会降息。那种心态的后果导致了2023年的银行业危机。所以我认为，银行业可能存在创伤后应激障碍（PTSD），这限制了他们，也限制了SLR的有效性。</p>
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> 感觉他们是在为<span class="tooltip">财政部总账户（TGA）<span class="tooltiptext">财政部总账户(TGA)：美国财政部的主要支票账户，用于大部分政府收支。其余额会影响市场流动性。</span></span>的大规模重建铺平道路。你看到了这种推动放松监管的动态，此外，我们开始看到他们试图真正通过GENIUS法案。目前，国债增长最快的买家是像Tether这样的稳定币。</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 id="section-3">The TGA Refill and Long Bond Yields / TGA补充与长期债券收益率</h2>
            <div class="lang-en">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> You have a situation where the TGA gets drawn down due to the debt ceiling, and then as soon as it gets resolved, they've got to rebuild it back up. That means a lot of bills issuance. Where do those flows come from? The last time this happened in 2023, they had a massive amount in the <span class="tooltip">Reverse Repo Program (RRP)<span class="tooltiptext">RRP (Reverse Repo Program): A Fed tool where money market funds can lend cash to the Fed overnight, effectively draining liquidity from the financial system.</span></span> to buffer this. This go-around, they have much less. The last two times these TGA refills happened, long-duration bond yields rose over 150 basis points.</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> I am of the belief that we do break out of the 5% on the long bond. The real catalyst is when the TGA refill starts. I think we're actually headed for a meaningful breakout in the 30-year, and it could be upwards of 100 basis points to over 6% later this year. I don't think it's good for risk assets. You're kind of stuck in that case because Fed cuts ultimately make things worse.</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> The 30-year has been touching 5%. It really doesn't seem like it wants to go lower. But this is a global issue. The Japanese 40-year keeps going higher. But when we think about longer-dated yields, we have to remember that there's a whole lot of tricks in the bag to keep it lower. One of them is to pull a Yellen-style activist Treasury issuance. Or they could use the SLR change to force banks to buy more Treasuries. Whenever a government has too much debt, one of the most common solutions is to have your commercial banks foot the bill. But until that happens, we probably have to have the long bond continue to go higher.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lang-zh">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> 由于债务上限问题，TGA的资金被耗尽，一旦问题解决，就必须重新补充。这意味着大量的短期国债（bills）发行。这些资金从何而来？上一次在2023年发生这种情况时，他们有大量的<span class="tooltip">逆回购工具（RRP）<span class="tooltiptext">逆回购工具(RRP)：美联储的一种工具，货币市场基金可以通过它隔夜向美联储借出现金，从而有效地从金融体系中抽走流动性。</span></span>作为缓冲。而这一次，他们的缓冲要少得多。前两次TGA补充期间，长期债券的收益率都上升了超过150个基点。</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> 我认为我们确实会突破长期债券5%的收益率。真正的催化剂是当TGA开始补充时。我认为30年期国债实际上将迎来一次有意义的突破，今年晚些时候可能会上升超过100个基点，达到6%以上。我不认为这对风险资产是好事。在这种情况下你有点被困住了，因为美联储的降息最终会让事情变得更糟。</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> 30年期国债收益率一直在触及5%，看起来真的不想再低了。但这是一个全球性问题，日本的40年期国债收益率也在持续走高。但当我们考虑长期收益率时，必须记住，有很多技巧可以让它保持在较低水平。其中之一就是采取耶伦式的“积极主义”国债发行策略。或者，他们可以利用SLR的改变来迫使银行购买更多的国债。每当一个政府债务过多时，最常见的解决方案之一就是让商业银行来买单。但在那发生之前，我们可能不得不看到长期债券收益率继续走高。</p>

            <h2 id="section-4">The Powell Succession and Future Fed Policy / 鲍威尔的继任者与未来的美联储政策</h2>
            <div class="lang-en">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> We have to start thinking about what happens in 2026 and who replaces Chair Powell. The market will start to discount this. What happens if we get a super dovish chair that cuts rates by 200 bps regardless of where we are in the economy? How does the market digest that?</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> The president gave an interview last week and he was like, "Chair Powell, he's like a stupid person. You know, maybe I'll just appoint myself." But I think that whoever President Trump appoints, it's going to be someone who's pretty dovish. If you were to really cut rates a lot, I think what I would be looking at is the dollar, because that could severely depreciate the dollar. That would be really bad for dollar assets. Longer-dated yields would go higher, but again, there are so many tools for the government to manage this. The government controls the computer. What they have less control of is the currency.</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> You wonder how much of the psychological benefit of that easing would be priced in ahead of time. Even if the new chair comes in and cuts 100 bps, it actually doesn't really lower interest expense all that much given the weighted average maturity of US debt. I'm not buying too much into the hysteria around this "shadow Fed" yet. But I do think as we get into Q4, it starts to become relevant.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lang-zh">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> 我们必须开始考虑2026年会发生什么，以及谁将接替鲍威尔主席。市场将开始计入这个因素。如果我们迎来一位超级鸽派的主席，无论经济状况如何都降息200个基点，会发生什么？市场将如何消化这种情况？</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> 总统上周接受采访时说：“鲍威尔主席，他就像个傻子。你知道，也许我就直接任命我自己。”但我认为，无论特朗普总统任命谁，都会是一个相当鸽派的人。如果你真的大幅降息，我认为我会关注美元，因为这可能会使美元严重贬值。这对美元资产将非常不利。长期收益率会走高，但同样，政府有很多工具来管理这一点。政府控制着那台计算机。他们较少控制的是货币本身。</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> 你会想，这种宽松政策的心理效益有多少会提前被市场定价。即使新主席上任并降息100个基点，考虑到美国债务的加权平均期限，实际上并不会真正降低太多利息支出。我目前对这个“影子美联储”的歇斯底里情绪还不太买账。但我确实认为，随着我们进入第四季度，这个问题会开始变得重要。</p>

            <h2 id="section-5">Fiscal Dominance and the Debate Over IORB / 财政主导与准备金利率之辩</h2>
            <div class="lang-en">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> Another theme is fiscal dominance. We've seen talk, led by Senator Ted Cruz, about removing interest on reserve balances (IORB), which was implemented in '08. The banks can park reserves at the Fed and earn a pretty good yield, which is effectively us subsidizing bank profits. What would be the impact if we actually removed IORB?</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> If we just went cold turkey and turned off IORB, it'd be tremendously disruptive. A bank like JP Morgan has a few hundred billion dollars of deposits at the Fed that suddenly yield nothing. They're going to go out and buy bills, lend in repo, and so forth, which will put downward pressure on all short-term interest rates. The federal funds market would disappear. It's not going to be how it's done. But right now, banks hold about $3 trillion in reserves, getting about $120 billion in interest income from the government. The government really doesn't need to be paying all that to them. So there's definitely scope to make it less. This is something the Fed has a right to do; they don't need Congress.</p>
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> I bring that up around this framing of fiscal dominance because it feels like the fiscal side is getting a lot more heavy-handed in creating the guardrails around monetary policy. It feels like a very different theme from the last 15 years.</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> Fiscal dominance has been with us since COVID, but also the examples in 2022 and 2023 banking crises. The reason they've had to step into the markets is because of the pressure on the long-term bond market. The worst case was the Bank of England gilt crisis in October '22. It's kind of where everybody's headed. The reason the US dollar is so at risk is because of the extreme concentration of US asset holdings by foreigners.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lang-zh">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> 另一个主题是<span class="tooltip">财政主导（Fiscal Dominance）<span class="tooltiptext">财政主导(Fiscal Dominance)：指财政政策（政府支出和税收）对货币政策产生决定性影响，迫使央行为政府赤字融资的情况。</span></span>。我们看到由参议员特德·克鲁兹牵头的讨论，关于取消<span class="tooltip">准备金余额利息（IORB）<span class="tooltiptext">准备金余额利息(IORB)：美联储向商业银行存放在央行的准备金支付的利息。</span></span>，这是2008年实施的政策。银行可以将准备金存放在美联储并获得可观的收益，这实际上是我们用印钞来补贴银行的利润。如果我们真的取消了IORB，会产生什么影响？</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> 如果我们直接取消IORB，将会造成巨大的破坏。像摩根大通这样的银行，在美联储有数千亿美元的存款，突然之间收益为零。他们会去购买短期国债，进行回购借贷等，这将对所有短期利率产生下行压力。联邦基金市场将消失。事情不会这么做。但目前，银行持有约3万亿美元的准备金，从政府那里获得约1200亿美元的利息收入。政府真的没必要把这些钱都付给他们。所以肯定有空间让它减少。这是美联储有权做的事情，他们不需要国会。</p>
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> 我在财政主导的框架下提出这一点，因为感觉财政方面在为货币政策设置护栏时，手段变得越来越强硬。这与过去15年的主题感觉非常不同。</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> 财政主导自新冠疫情以来就一直存在，2022年和2023年的银行业危机也是例子。他们之所以不得不介入市场，是因为长期债券市场面临压力。最糟糕的例子是2022年10月的英国国债危机。这基本上是所有国家的发展方向。美元之所以如此危险，是因为外国人持有美国资产的极度集中。</p>

            <h2 id="section-6">Global Capital Flows and the US Dollar's Future / 全球资本流动与美元的未来</h2>
            <div class="lang-en">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> I want to zoom out and talk about global capital flows and the geopolitical situation. What's developing in the Middle East is increasing tail risk for oil, inflation, and long bond yields. Then there's this situation around global capital flows. You mentioned the blowoff top in American exceptionalism. A lot of that is tied to tariffs and balance of payments resolution. So I'm curious where you guys are at in this thesis of American exceptionalism.</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> We saw that after "Liberation Day," the dollar sold off, Treasuries sold off, and US equities sold off, and then you had tremendous outperformance in European markets. The theme then was that the US was overexposed. Since what's happened in the Middle East, US assets seem to be doing a bit better. But my read is that the dollar safe-haven bid is not really strong. I think this move away from US exceptionalism is a structural theme. It's not going to happen in one day. That glimpse of it we saw on Liberation Day, I think we'll see it again.</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> There's record short positioning in the dollar. Every bank research report I get, their highest conviction trade is short dollar. But ultimately, if there is a larger decline in US assets, and foreigners are loaded up to the gills on exposure, they're taking nominal wealth hits. So, yes, there's this dynamic of repatriation, but if you're doing that from a minus 10% or 20% basis, it's not like they're flourishing. The reflexivity of if that changes and how many people need to scrap their plans creates flows that beget flows. It's a very inflationary outcome for us.</p>
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> People have been talking about the dollar losing reserve status for my entire life. How do you both appropriately discount the two possibilities? It feels irresponsible to not consider it, but at the same time, that's been a losing trade for many years.</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> I won't say reserve currency is being lost, but weakened and depreciated. That seems so obvious to me. We're doing so many things that are antagonizing foreigners, discouraging them to hold our assets. And there's a sense that the administration doesn't actually want to have the reserve currency because they think the burden outweighs the benefits. To have a stronger manufacturing export sector, we need a weaker dollar.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lang-zh">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> 我想把视野放宽，谈谈全球资本流动和地缘政治局势。中东的发展正在增加石油、通胀和长期债券收益率的尾部风险。然后是全球资本流动的问题。你提到了“美国例外论”的顶峰。这很大程度上与关税和国际收支的解决方案有关。所以我很好奇你们对“美国例外论”这个论点的看法。</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> 我们看到，在“解放日”之后，美元、国债和美国股市都遭到了抛售，而欧洲市场则表现出色。当时的主题是美国风险敞口过大。自中东事件发生以来，美国资产似乎表现得好一些。但我的解读是，美元的避险买盘并不强劲。我认为这种告别美国例外论的趋势是一个结构性主题。它不会在一天之内发生。我们在解放日看到的那个苗头，我认为我们还会再次看到。</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> 美元的空头头寸创下了记录。我收到的每一份银行研究报告，他们最有信心的交易就是做空美元。但最终，如果美国资产出现较大下跌，而外国人持有大量敞口，他们将遭受名义上的财富损失。所以，是的，存在资金回流的动态，但如果你是在下跌10%或20%的基础上这么做，那他们也并非欣欣向荣。如果情况发生变化，以及有多少人需要调整计划，这种反身性会创造出自我加强的资金流。这对我们来说是一个非常通胀的结果。</p>
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> 我这辈子都在听人们谈论美元失去储备货币地位。你们俩如何恰当地权衡这两种可能性？不考虑它感觉不负责任，但与此同时，这多年来一直是个失败的交易。</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> 我不会说储备货币地位正在丧失，但正在被削弱和贬值。这对来我说似乎很明显。我们正在做很多事情，惹恼外国人，不鼓励他们持有我们的资产。而且有一种感觉是，本届政府实际上不想要储备货币地位，因为他们认为随之而来的负担超过了好处。为了拥有更强大的制造业出口部门，我们需要一个更弱的美元。</p>

            <h2 id="section-7">Navigating the Current Market: Portfolio Strategy / 驾驭当前市场：投资组合策略</h2>
            <div class="lang-en">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> So, just to wrap this up, how to navigate from a portfolio standpoint everything we just talked about? It feels like almost every asset class has some sort of landmine associated with it. To me, it sort of feels like you're left with gold and Bitcoin.</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> I hate the risk-reward for almost every asset. I think the most money to be made over the next 12 months is probably on the short side of most assets. If you're in cash, you're long the dollar, and even that is probably not that safe. So, inflation-protected securities, bonds, TIPS, things like that. And playing the short side. Playing currencies more often than you would to protect your purchasing power. Bitcoin is the liquidity release valve, and if Powell's committing to being three to six months delayed on cutting, that's not an attractive setup either. So, I think like short bonds, short equities almost.</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> I agree with you guys. I think there's a lot of things happening. For my subscribers, I have a market view portfolio to help people think through how to position. In that portfolio, there's only two things: it's cash and gold. And hopefully, as some of these riskier things materialize and if the currency continues to decline, like I think it will, I think there'll be good buying opportunities in the coming months. Personally, I like the short side, too.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lang-zh">
                <p><strong>Felix:</strong> 那么，总结一下，从投资组合的角度来看，如何驾驭我们刚才讨论的所有情况？感觉几乎每一种资产类别都伴随着某种地雷。对我来说，感觉好像只剩下黄金和比特币了。</p>
                <p><strong>Quinn Thompson:</strong> 我讨厌几乎所有资产的风险回报比。我认为未来12个月最能赚钱的可能是在大多数资产的空头方面。如果你持有现金，你就是做多美元，但即使那样也可能不安全。所以，通胀保值证券、债券、TIPS之类的东西，还有做空。比平时更频繁地交易货币来保护你的购买力。比特币是流动性的释放阀，如果鲍威尔承诺要延迟三到六个月才降息，那也不是一个有吸引力的设置。所以，我觉得差不多可以做空债券、做空股票。</p>
                <p><strong>Joseph Wang:</strong> 我同意你们。我认为发生了很多事情。对于我的订阅者，我有一个市场观点投资组合，帮助人们思考如何定位。在那个投资组合中，只有两样东西：现金和黄金。希望随着一些风险事件的发生，以及如果货币像我认为的那样继续贬值，未来几个月会有好的买入机会。就我个人而言，我也喜欢做空。</p>
