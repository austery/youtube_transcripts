            <p class="speaker-name">Ladislav Roškot:</p>
            <p class="en-text">Hello and welcome to PFI talks brought to you by Prague Finance Institute, an affiliate of the leading Czech economics research center, CERGE-EI. My name is Ladislav Roškot. I'm the head of communications at PPF Group and the host of this podcast. I'm pleased to welcome Kenneth Rogoff, distinguished professor of economics at Harvard and the former IMF chief economist. Mr. Rogoff is an accomplished chess player and author of many books on economics. His latest, *Our Dollar, Your Problem* is a sweeping history of the world's dominant currencies and where the dollar may be headed. Hello, professor.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">大家好，欢迎收听由布拉格金融学院（PFI）为您带来的PFI访谈。该学院是捷克顶尖经济学研究中心CERGE-EI的附属机构。我是主持人拉迪斯拉夫·罗什科特，PPF集团的公关主管。我很高兴能邀请到肯尼斯·罗格夫先生，他是哈佛大学的经济学杰出教授，也是国际货币基金组织的前首席经济学家。罗格夫先生不仅是一位成就斐然的国际象棋手，还撰写了多本经济学著作。他最新的作品《我们的美元，你们的问题》全面回顾了世界主导货币的历史，并探讨了美元未来的走向。您好，教授。</p>

            <p class="speaker-name">Kenneth Rogoff:</p>
            <p class="en-text">Greetings.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">你好。</p>

            <p class="speaker-name">Ladislav Roškot:</p>
            <p class="en-text">Since we are talking about your book, you discuss various currencies other than the dollar that have attempted to become dominant. For someone like myself with experience from the former Soviet bloc, it was very interesting to read how you, as a chess player in the 70s or 80s, viewed the potential dominance of the so-called convertible ruble. Of course, it was used for settling trades within the Comecon countries, but internally, we all laughed at it; it was just a fig leaf, and everyone wanted the greenback. Was that fear really based on something relevant at the time, or was it just a lack of data from the Soviet Union?</p>
            <p class="zh-text">既然我们谈到您的书，您在书中讨论了除美元外，其他曾试图成为主导货币的各种货币。对于像我这样有前苏联集团生活经历的人来说，读到您作为一名国际象棋手，在70或80年代如何看待所谓的“可兑换卢布”的潜在主导地位，感到非常有趣。当然，它被用于经互会（Comecon）国家内部的贸易结算，但在我们内部，大家都在嘲笑它；它不过是块遮羞布，人人都想要美元。当时那种担忧真的基于什么现实依据吗？还是仅仅因为缺乏来自苏联的数据？<br><span class="explanation">注：可兑换卢布（Convertible Ruble）是苏联时期用于经互会成员国之间贸易结算的记账单位，并非真正可自由兑换的货币。绿钞（Greenback）是美元的俗称。</span></p>

            <p class="speaker-name">Kenneth Rogoff:</p>
            <p class="en-text">First of all, as a teenager traveling around Eastern Europe and interacting with many Russians, I wasn't thinking, "Boy, I want your currency. Can we swap dollars for rubles?" No, that wasn't on my mind. It was only as an undergraduate at Yale, where I took a course on Russian economics, that I encountered a significant debate on this. The most famous economist of the 20th century, Paul Samuelson, predicted in his widely-read textbook not that the ruble would catch up with the dollar, but that Russia as an economy would catch up with the United States. While the exact form of the ruble was uncertain, it would have certainly had a big footprint in the global economy. I was a freshman taking this course in 1972, and he was predicting this catch-up to occur sometime between 1987 and 1994, based on extrapolation, much like people do today.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">首先，当我还是个青少年，在东欧旅行并与许多俄罗斯人打交道时，我并没有想：“天啊，我想要你们的货币。我们能用美元换卢布吗？”不，我没那么想。直到我在耶鲁大学读本科，选修了一门关于苏联经济的课程时，才接触到关于这个问题的激烈辩论。20世纪最著名的经济学家之一保罗·萨缪尔森，在他那本被广泛阅读的教科书中预测，不是卢布会赶上美元，而是俄罗斯作为一个经济体将赶上美国。虽然卢布的具体形态尚不确定，但它无疑会在全球经济中占据重要地位。我在1972年还是个大一新生，在上这门课，他预测这种追赶会发生在1987年到1994年之间的某个时候，这完全是基于外推法，就像今天人们做的那样。</p>
            <p class="en-text">It wasn't just him. Leading economists like Walter Rostow, a superstar and major player in development economics, also predicted this. Back then at Yale, the clever papers were not about why Russia worked so badly, but why it worked. We didn't have the data. The Russians didn't make it easy to get, and second, without a market economy where you can aggregate prices—which is how we measure income—it left a lot of room for creative accounting. But it wasn't just that. Visibly, Russia put a man in space ahead of the United States. They excelled in physics, math, and many other fields. To the outside eye, they had spectacular accomplishments. Now it seems laughable, but when I was a teenager watching my neighbor build a bomb shelter, it didn't seem laughable at all.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">而且不只是他。像沃尔特·罗斯托这样的顶尖经济学家，他是发展经济学领域的巨星和主要人物，也做出了同样的预测。那时候在耶鲁，那些高明的论文不是关于为什么苏联运作得如此糟糕，而是关于它为什么能成功。我们没有数据。苏联方面不轻易提供数据，其次，没有一个可以汇总价格的市场经济——而这正是我们衡量收入的方式——这为“创造性会计”留下了大量空间。但不仅如此。显而易见的是，苏联在美国之前将人送入了太空。他们在物理、数学和许多其他领域都表现出色。在外界看来，他们取得了惊人的成就。现在这看起来很可笑，但当我还是个青少年，看着邻居修建防空洞时，这可一点都不可笑。</p>

            <h2>The Dollar’s Peak and Gradual Decline</h2>
            <h2>美元的顶峰与渐进式衰落</h2>

            <p class="speaker-name">Ladislav Roškot:</p>
            <p class="en-text">But wasn't there a chance for the Soviets to elevate the convertible ruble to a proper, at least regionally dominant, currency? Especially since they became very dominant players in hydrocarbon trades with Western Europe.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">但是，苏联难道没有机会将可兑换卢布提升为一种真正的、至少是区域性的主导货币吗？特别是考虑到他们在与西欧的油气贸易中占据了主导地位。</p>

            <p class="speaker-name">Kenneth Rogoff:</p>
            <p class="en-text">By the time the Soviet Union fell, it was apparent that the whole economy was smoke and mirrors. They were producing hydrocarbons, but today the Russian economy is, I don't know, 1/15th the size of the United States. This is old history. Had Russia adopted reforms like China did—like the Kosygin-Brezhnev reforms they attempted—with some flavor of what Deng Xiaoping did, making some things market-oriented, it would have performed much better. I don't know about a convertible ruble, but their footprint in Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia might have expanded. Look at China today. Russia wasn't programmed to fail the way it did; it made some bad mistakes along the way.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">到苏联解体时，整个经济显然就是一场海市蜃楼。他们确实生产油气，但今天的俄罗斯经济规模，我不知道，大概只有美国的十五分之一。这都是陈年旧事了。如果俄罗斯当初能像中国那样进行改革——比如他们曾尝试过的柯西金-勃列日涅夫改革——并带有一些邓小平改革的色彩，让某些领域市场化，它的表现会好得多。我不知道会不会有可兑换卢布，但他们在东欧、非洲和亚洲的影响力可能会扩大。看看今天的中国。俄罗斯并非注定要以那种方式失败；它在一路上犯了一些严重的错误。</p>
            <p class="en-text">My view, looking from a historical perspective post-World War II and considering the underlying economics, is that the dollar peaked maybe 10 years ago in terms of its global footprint. Asia is 50% of the dollar bloc by the measure I use with my co-authors. China has been moving away from that since 2015, and as China moves away, so do others, because it's the biggest exporter and importer for many countries. When currencies change, it doesn't happen overnight; it can happen over a couple of decades. Another currency moves in and takes some of the space. I believe there are many weaknesses in the dollar, some coming from the rest of the world's dislike for it, and also from our own internal problems—pressures to undermine the Federal Reserve, protectionism, and challenges to the rule of law. This was all leading to a loss of the dollar's footprint, even before recent events.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">我的观点是，从二战后的历史视角并结合基础经济学来看，美元的全球影响力可能在10年前就已经达到了顶峰。根据我和我的合著者使用的衡量标准，亚洲占了美元区的50%。自2015年以来，中国一直在逐步脱离这个体系，随着中国的离开，其他国家也在效仿，因为中国是许多国家最大的出口国和进口国。当货币地位发生变化时，它不会在一夜之间发生，而可能持续几十年。另一种货币会进入并占据部分空间。我认为美元存在许多弱点，一些源于世界其他国家对它的不满，另一些则源于我们自身的内部问题——削弱美联储的压力、保护主义以及对法治的挑战。即便在最近的事件发生之前，这一切都在导致美元影响力的丧失。</p>

            <h2>The Connally Quote: "Our Dollar, Your Problem"</h2>
            <h2>康纳利的名言：“我们的美元，你们的问题”</h2>

            <p class="speaker-name">Ladislav Roškot:</p>
            <p class="en-text">This is a great segue to the title of your book, which is actually a quote from John Connally, a US politician. Can you tell us more about the story of the title and about John Connally?</p>
            <p class="zh-text">这正好引出了您书的标题，它实际上是引用了美国政治家约翰·康纳利的一句话。您能给我们多讲讲这个标题背后的故事以及约翰·康纳利这个人吗？</p>

            <p class="speaker-name">Kenneth Rogoff:</p>
            <p class="en-text">John Connally was a very colorful character from Texas. He was in the car with John F. Kennedy when he was shot and was badly injured himself. Almost 10 years later, he became President Nixon's Treasury Secretary. Back then, our exchange rate system was based on the dollar being as good as gold; governments could trade dollars for gold. It was a successful period of growth for Europe. However, the US started to expand social programs and fight the Vietnam War, leading to inflation. If you have inflation while your currency is fixed to gold, it's not consistent. So, Nixon said, "Sorry everyone, you can't trade your dollars for gold anymore."</p>
            <p class="zh-text">约翰·康纳利是来自德克萨斯州一位非常富有传奇色彩的人物。约翰·F·肯尼迪被枪杀时，他就坐在同一辆车里，自己也受了重伤。近10年后，他成为了尼克松总统的财政部长。当时，我们的汇率体系是建立在美元与黄金挂钩的基础上的；各国政府可以用美元兑换黄金。那段时期欧洲经济增长迅猛。然而，美国开始扩大社会项目并进行越南战争，导致了通货膨胀。如果你的货币与黄金挂钩，同时又存在通胀，这是不可持续的。于是，尼克松说：“对不起了各位，你们不能再用美元换黄金了。”</p>
            <p class="en-text">Everyone was apoplectic. Nixon sent John Connally to meet with them, and they asked, "What are we supposed to do?" He replied, "It's our dollar, it's your problem." I like the title because I've always felt Americans are incredibly arrogant, and it points to that. But there's an irony: the inflation was a disaster for the United States. It was *our* problem too. This expresses both the arrogance and the irony. It's fitting because many of the things we do today will ultimately become our own problem.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">所有人都怒不可遏。尼克松派约翰·康纳利去和他们会面，他们问：“我们该怎么办？”康纳利回答说：“这是我们的美元，但这是你们的问题。”我喜欢这个标题，因为我一直觉得美国人极其傲慢，这句话正指出了这一点。但其中也有一种讽刺：那场通货膨胀对美国来说是一场灾难。它同样也是*我们*的问题。这句话既表达了傲慢，也揭示了讽刺。这很贴切，因为我们今天做的很多事情，最终也会成为我们自己的问题。</p>

            <h2>Historical Parallel: The Japanese Yen and the Plaza Accord</h2>
            <h2>历史的相似之处：日元与广场协议</h2>

            <p class="speaker-name">Ladislav Roškot:</p>
            <p class="en-text">There was a fear in the US about the Japanese yen and Japan becoming the world's largest economy. There was a push to make their currency appreciate, and you say they were bullied into it at the Plaza Accord. At the same time, it seemed the Americans weren't even sure if the Japanese could achieve it, and then everyone was shocked when they did.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">美国曾对日元和日本成为世界最大经济体感到担忧。当时有一股力量推动日元升值，您提到他们在《广场协议》中是被迫接受的。但与此同时，美国人似乎也不确定日本人是否能做到这一点，而当他们真的做到时，所有人都震惊了。<br><span class="explanation">注：《广场协议》（Plaza Accord）是1985年美国、日本、联邦德国、法国和英国财长在纽约广场饭店达成的协议，旨在联合干预外汇市场，使美元对日元及马克等主要货币有序贬值，以解决美国巨额贸易赤字问题。</span></p>

            <p class="speaker-name">Kenneth Rogoff:</p>
            <p class="en-text">That's a very important event. The Plaza Accord happened in the mid-80s when Japan's economy was killing it. The US was trying to figure out what to do. The Reagan administration decided they had to make Japan's currency higher because it was too cheap. They weren't sure it would work, but the Japanese Finance Minister, after consulting back in Tokyo, came back and said, "We're going to make it happen." And they did. They aimed to make their currency stronger by 10%, but it doubled. It appreciated far more than anyone anticipated.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">那是一个非常重要的事件。《广场协议》发生在80年代中期，当时日本经济势不可挡。美国在想方设法应对。里根政府决定，他们必须让日元升值，因为它太便宜了。他们不确定这是否能奏效，但日本财务大臣在返回东京商议后，回来表示：“我们会让它发生。”他们做到了。他们的目标是让货币升值10%，但结果是翻了一番。升值幅度远超所有人的预期。</p>
            <p class="en-text">The Chinese talk about this all the time: "You are not going to do this to us." My initial reaction was that while Japan did have a crisis, it was six years later, and in between, its stock market tripled. But as I reflected on it, I realized we bullied them into doing something they weren't ready for. They didn't have the regulatory infrastructure to handle the massive capital inflows. They built up a problem very similar to what we did in 2008-2009. So, it's a fascinating episode and a cautionary tale.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">中国人总是谈论这件事：“你们休想对我们做同样的事。”我最初的反应是，虽然日本后来确实经历了危机，但那是在六年之后，而在此期间，它的股市翻了三倍。但随着我反思，我意识到我们是强迫他们做了一件他们尚未准备好的事。他们没有相应的监管基础设施来处理大规模的资本流入。他们制造了一个与我们在2008-2009年非常相似的问题。所以，这是一个引人入胜的插曲，也是一个警示故事。</p>

            <h2>Modern Challenges: Trump's Policies and De-globalization</h2>
            <h2>现代挑战：特朗普的政策与去全球化</h2>

            <p class="speaker-name">Ladislav Roškot:</p>
            <p class="en-text">Isn't Donald Trump trying to replicate this, to bring manufacturing from China to the US? Is that even replicable under the current circumstances, given Chinese opposition?</p>
            <p class="zh-text">唐纳德·特朗普现在不也是在试图复制这种做法，想把制造业从中国迁回美国吗？在当前形势下，考虑到中国的反对，这真的可以复制吗？</p>

            <p class="speaker-name">Kenneth Rogoff:</p>
            <p class="en-text">The idea that you can become a much more closed economy without losing wealth vastly is just nonsense. You can't turn back the clock. There are complex national security issues to consider, for example, in shipbuilding or medicine manufacturing. But that's not an argument for taxing French wine or Canadian lumber. I don't know any economist who can explain his vision. What's missed is that you don't get dollar dominance at the other end of this. You inevitably get a shrinking of the dollar's footprint. If we have high tariffs, you don't integrate as much financially. We may have been killing it in global finance, tech, and farming. The idea you can cherry-pick and close off manufacturing while keeping everything else is just not going to work out in the long run. This process was ongoing anyway; he is an accelerant.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">认为一个经济体可以在变得更加封闭的同时不遭受巨大的财富损失，这纯属无稽之谈。你无法让时光倒流。当然，有一些复杂的国家安全问题需要考虑，比如在造船或药品制造领域。但这不能成为对法国红酒或加拿大木材征税的理由。我不知道有哪位经济学家能解释他的愿景。人们忽略了一点：这么做的最终结果不会是美元霸权，而是不可避免地导致美元影响力的萎缩。如果我们设置高关税，金融一体化程度就会降低。我们可能在全球金融、科技和农业领域表现卓越。但那种以为可以挑挑拣拣，只封闭制造业而保持其他一切照旧的想法，从长远来看是行不通的。这个进程本就在发生，他只是一个加速器。</p>

            <h2>The Future of Global Currencies</h2>
            <h2>全球货币的未来</h2>

            <p class="speaker-name">Ladislav Roškot:</p>
            <p class="en-text">You say a currency's dominance lasts about 100 to 150 years. What could come after the dollar? A global currency, a basket, or crypto?</p>
            <p class="zh-text">您说一种货币的主导地位大约持续100到150年。美元之后会是什么？全球货币、一篮子货币，还是加密货币？</p>

            <p class="speaker-name">Kenneth Rogoff:</p>
            <p class="en-text">I spend a lot of time on this in the book. In my lifetime, the dollar will always be there, but it will be less dominant, and there will be other things. I don't think it will be crypto, but crypto does compete for the world's underground economy, which is probably 20-25% of global GDP. What I have more conviction about in the near term is a world of much more volatility. We lived in a special globalization era where it was easy for central banks to be independent, but the political economy is coming back with a vengeance. The idea that central banks will always be independent is just nonsense. So, I think there are reasons we might live in a more unstable world.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">我在书中花了很多时间讨论这个问题。在我有生之年，美元将永远存在，但其主导地位会减弱，并且会出现其他替代品。我认为不会是加密货币，但加密货币确实在争夺全球地下经济的市场，这部分可能占全球GDP的20-25%。我近期更有把握的判断是，世界将进入一个波动性大得多的时期。我们曾生活在一个特殊的全球化时代，央行很容易保持独立，但现在政治经济学正卷土重来。认为央行将永远保持独立，这纯属无稽之谈。因此，我认为我们有理由相信，未来将生活在一个更加不稳定的世界里。</p>

            <p class="zh-text">我们谈了很多拥有主导货币的好处。除了失去这些优势之外，还有什么坏处吗？</p>

            <p class="speaker-name">Kenneth Rogoff:</p>
            <p class="en-text">One point is that you have to be one of the dominant military powers. You don't get to have a currency used outside your area if you don't project military force. It's not just about enforcing contracts; it's about having influence over the rules of the game. That's expensive. I don't want to call the entire cost of that a consequence of having a reserve currency, but you have to bear it. Another subtle cost is that you have to be prepared to take it on the chin in a recession. The dollar tends to go up in a panic, but during a global recession, the US experiences capital losses on its holdings in the rest of the world. So that is also a cost of having a dominant currency.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">其中一点是，你必须是主导军事力量之一。如果你不投射军事力量，你的货币就无法在你的区域之外被使用。这不仅仅是关于执行合同，而是关乎对游戏规则的影响力。这是昂贵的。我不想把这全部成本都归因于拥有储备货币，但你必须承担它。另一个微妙的成本是，在经济衰退中你必须准备好承受打击。在恐慌时期，美元倾向于升值，但在全球经济衰退期间，美国在其世界其他地区的资产上会遭受资本损失。所以，这也是拥有主导货币的一个成本。</p>
            <p class="en-text">The US has incredible economic advantages: we are the world's biggest oil producer, we have incredible farmland, and an incredible ability to absorb immigrants. We have a lot of great advantages, but you can throw them out the window.</p>
            <p class="zh-text">美国拥有难以置信的经济优势：我们是世界上最大的石油生产国，我们有无与伦比的农田，以及吸收移民的惊人能力。我们有很多巨大的优势，但你也可以把它们弃之不顾。</p>
