            <div class="episode-info">
                <p>On this episode of "The Ben & Marc Show", a16z co-founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz sit down with legendary music producer and bestselling author Rick Rubin to explore the origin of his unexpected new creation: "The Way of Code".</p>
                <p>Blending ancient philosophy and modern AI, The Way of Code reimagines the 3,000-year-old Tao Te Ching for the age of artificial intelligence, software, and “vibe coding.” What began as a viral tweet quickly evolved into a creative manifesto—part book, part tool, part spiritual operating system for the future.</p>
                <p>Joined by a16z General Partners Anjney Midha and Erik Torenberg, the group dives deep into topics such as how Rick became a meme for Vibe Coding, why AI is just another artistic tool, remix culture, creativity, collective consciousness, and why great founders and artists need to stay true to themselves.</p>
                <p>With shout outs to punk rock, the collective unconscious, and Johnny Cash’s famed acoustic sessions, this conversation is a sprawling, soul-searching journey across music, philosophy, tech, and truth. We hope you enjoy this deeply personal and surprisingly practical conversation on how to live—and create—in the age of AI.</p>

            <h2>Intro: Rick Rubin and The Way of Code / 引言：里克·鲁宾与《编程之道》</h2>
            <p class="english">So many people I know who use AI ask it questions and think that the results that they get back is the answer. And it seems like people are more interested in getting an answer that can allow them to stop thinking about the question than really finding out what the real answer is. I'm so interested in what AI really can know based on what is and not what we tell it we think it is.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我认识的许多使用人工智能的人，他们向人工智能提问，并认为得到的结果就是答案。而且似乎人们更感兴趣的是得到一个能让他们停止思考问题的答案，而不是真正找出真正的答案是什么。我非常感兴趣的是，人工智能真正能知道什么是基于客观存在，而不是基于我们告诉它我们认为它是什么。</p>
            <p class="english">We are here today to discuss Rick's new album, The Way of Code. Rick, what is The Way of Code? The Way of Code is a book about vibe coding. And it's a book about vibe coding by way of a 3,000-year-old spiritual text called The Dao De Jing, written by Lao Tzu. Ah.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我们今天在这里讨论里克的新专辑《编程之道》。里克，《编程之道》是什么？《编程之道》是一本关于氛围编程的书。它是一本通过一部有3000年历史、由老子所著的精神文本《道德经》来阐述氛围编程的书。啊。</p>
            <p class="english">Uh so it's an it's an interesting the idea of a 3,000-year-old uh wisdom teaching combined with cutting edge technology. That's what the way of code is. And the subtitle is the timeless art of vibe coding. And I like the idea of the timeless art of vibe coding considering the term vibe coding is maybe 10 weeks old.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，所以这是一个有趣的想法，将一个有3000年历史的智慧教导与尖端技术相结合。这就是《编程之道》的内涵。它的副标题是“氛围编程的永恒艺术”。考虑到“氛围编程”这个词可能才出现10周，我喜欢“氛围编程的永恒艺术”这个提法。</p>
            <p class="english">Yes. I felt we now have the timeless art of something 10 weeks old is interesting to me. So, here it is. And it's it's weird to hear you call it a book because when I when you first sent me the link and I started reading it, it felt like I was using software. So, why do you call it a book versus a website or an app or the many other things you could have described it as?</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。我觉得我们现在拥有了一门仅有10周历史事物的永恒艺术，这对我来说很有趣。所以，它就在这里。听你称它为一本书感觉很奇怪，因为当你第一次发给我链接我开始阅读时，感觉就像在使用软件。那么，你为什么称它为书，而不是网站、应用程序或其他许多你可以用来描述它的东西呢？</p>
            <p class="english">Well, I wrote it as a book. It started as a book and then I happened to meet I was um I invited Jack Clark on to the Tetragrammaton podcast and I recorded with him. The episode's not out yet but we recorded about 3 weeks ago and I had just finished the book and after the podcast I said I wrote this book. Do you want to check it out? and he looked at it and he said, "hm, I feel like there's a way we could do something with this, build it into a website and uh have a way to demonstrate vibe coding within the website." So, that's how the website came about.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，我是把它当作一本书来写的。它开始时是一本书，然后我碰巧遇到了，我当时邀请了杰克·克拉克上Tetragrammaton播客，并与他录制了一期节目。那期节目还没播出，但我们大约在3周前录制的，我刚写完这本书。播客结束后，我说我写了这本书，你想看看吗？他看了看说：“嗯，我觉得我们可以用这个做点什么，把它建成一个网站，并在网站内展示氛围编程。”所以，网站就是这么来的。</p>
            <p class="english">Ah, gotcha. Well, it it feels kind of poetic for it to be vibe coding and have built-in vibe coding with each verse. The idea of originally the Anthropic people said could you give us a list of prompts to create the art and I said I think the art would be best created using the text of the book to create the art and then we can give it mods to modify the art and we'll suggest some mods but you can also make up your own mods so you can say I want it to look like it was painted by Cézanne or I want it to look like uh it's melting or I want it to look like what's the what's the um what's the Nordic version look like and it'll do those things or what's the technicolor version or make it spin fast or make it spin slow. You can ask it to to make whatever changes you'd like it to.</p>
            <p class="chinese">啊，明白了。嗯，它本身就是氛围编程，并且每一节都内置了氛围编程，这感觉有点诗意。最初Anthropic的人说，你能给我们一个提示列表来创作艺术吗？我说，我认为最好的方式是使用书中的文本来创作艺术，然后我们可以给它一些修饰符来修改艺术，我们会建议一些修饰符，但你也可以自己创造修饰符。所以你可以说，我希望它看起来像塞尚画的，或者我希望它看起来像在融化，或者我希望它看起来像北欧风格是什么样的，它就会做这些事情；或者彩色电影版是什么样的，或者让它快速旋转，或者让它缓慢旋转。你可以要求它做出你想要的任何改变。</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Remix Culture and AI as Creative Tool / 混音文化与作为创作工具的人工智能</h2>
            <p class="english">So there's I mean my my head was exploding when I saw this because it felt like a watching the the art of remixing music which I've heard you know Ben talk about many many times before as the heart and soul of hip-hop right sampling. That's what that's the first thing that I saw when when or I that that it evoked for me when I when I read this was is that where the idea came from. All art is a version of sampling and remixing. It doesn't start from zero. We're not we we're not um we come in empty. We feed back based on what's coming at us. And that's what that's what all artists do. So remixing is kind of what all art is. It's we know it very specifically in the hip-hop world, but that's really when the Beatles listened to Roy Orbison and then wrote Please Me based on his Please, Roy Orbison's Please song. That was remixing. It's always been that.</p>
            <p class="chinese">所以，我的意思是，当我看到这个时，我的脑袋都要炸了，因为它感觉就像在观看音乐混音的艺术，我听本（Ben）以前多次谈到过，这是嘻哈音乐的核心和灵魂，对吧，采样。这是我读到这个时，它在我脑海中唤起的第一个想法，这个点子是不是来源于此？所有艺术都是采样和混音的一种形式。它不是从零开始的。我们不是，我们不是空手而来的。我们根据接收到的信息进行反馈。所有艺术家都是这样做的。所以混音在某种程度上就是所有艺术的本质。我们在嘻哈世界里对此有非常具体的认识，但实际上，当披头士听了罗伊·奥比森的歌，然后根据他的《Please》（罗伊·奥比森的《Please》这首歌）写了《Please Me》时，那就是混音。一直都是这样。</p>
            <p class="english">And why do you think there's kind of such strong resistance to kind of this version this kind of remixing? So both with sampling and and vibe coding to to a large extent like a lot of people got very upset that you know it's not being done the old way like here's this new version of of the thing that we all do.</p>
            <p class="chinese">那你认为为什么会对这种混音形式，这种版本的混音，产生如此强烈的抵制呢？无论是对于采样，还是在很大程度上对于氛围编程，很多人都非常不满，认为这不是用老方法做的，好像这是我们都在做的事情的一个新版本。</p>
            <p class="english">I think there's a misconception that the computer now does the work, but really the computer is it's another tool. It's like a guitar or a sampler or it's another tool in the artist's arsenal. But the reason we go to the artists we go to or the writers we go to or the filmmakers we go to is for their point of view. The AI doesn't have a point of view, right? A point of view is what you tell it. What you tell it the point of view is to be. So you can have a script, a great script for a film and you give it to five great directors and you'll get five very different movies. It's true with everything. If you give the same song to different artists, they interpret it differently. So AI gives you the ability to take your ideas, feed it into this machine, and then get back different iterations that normally you would do, but it would just take you much longer. It's more of a modeling process. Yeah.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我认为存在一种误解，即认为现在是计算机在完成工作，但实际上计算机只是另一种工具。它就像一把吉他或一个采样器，是艺术家武器库中的另一种工具。但我们之所以去欣赏某些艺术家、作家或电影制作人的作品，是因为他们的观点。人工智能没有观点，对吧？观点是你告诉它的。你告诉它观点应该是什么。所以你可以有一个剧本，一部电影的优秀剧本，你把它交给五个伟大的导演，你会得到五部截然不同的电影。任何事情都是如此。如果你把同一首歌给不同的艺术家，他们会以不同的方式诠释它。所以人工智能让你能够将你的想法输入到这台机器中，然后得到不同的迭代版本，这些版本通常你自己也能做出来，但会花费你更长的时间。这更像是一个建模过程。是的。</p>
            <p class="english">If you understand it as you're not just asking it to make art, you're asking it to uh bring your dreams to life in the same way that you would in a wood shop. Say it's the same thing. It's a just another tool for you to for you as the artist to make the thing that you want to make. If you think it's doing it, it's it's only doing what you're telling it to do. And all it knows is what other people have told it to do. It doesn't it doesn't have any of its I I don't know that it has any of its own thoughts yet. And I don't know if it's possible. I feel like the the real strength of it would be if it could have its own thoughts. Seems like the companies that control this really want to keep it to the way humans do things.</p>
            <p class="chinese">如果你把它理解为你不仅仅是要求它创作艺术，而是要求它将你的梦想变为现实，就像你在木工房里做的那样。可以说这是一回事。它只是你作为艺术家创作你想要的东西的又一个工具。如果你认为它在创作，那它只是在做你告诉它去做的事情。它所知道的一切都是别人告诉它去做的。它没有任何，我不知道它现在是否拥有任何自己的想法。我也不知道这是否可能。我觉得它真正的力量在于如果它能拥有自己的想法。似乎控制这项技术的公司真的希望把它限制在人类做事的方式上。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. Well, and that's, you know, currently what they that's the current state-of-the-art for sure.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。嗯，你知道，目前这确实是他们的，是当前最先进的技术水平。</p>
            <p class="english">Um so so in a sense it's basic it is it's like a guitar or a pen or or anything that you would create art with. It's just at a different low level. You know we went through this in computer science early on where it used to be machine coding. We called it machine coding um which we did with punch cards and you would basically instruct the machine on like okay move this bit you know from here to there uh and and these kinds of things and jump to this line in the program and so forth and then we got to higher level programming and there was great resistance by the way you know from the kind of people who are great at assembly code because they said well that high-level programming is so inefficient like how could you waste all those computer cycles it's horrible. Um and you know at every step of the way I think the crafts people at the prior generation of tools get a little upset about the the kind of new generation of tools.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，所以在某种意义上，它基本上就像一把吉他、一支笔，或者任何你可以用来创作艺术的东西。只是它处于一个不同的底层。你知道，我们早期在计算机科学领域经历过这个阶段，那时是机器编码。我们称之为机器编码，我们用打孔卡来做，你基本上会指示机器，比如，好的，把这个比特从这里移到那里，诸如此类的事情，然后跳转到程序的这一行等等。然后我们发展到了更高级的编程语言，顺便说一句，那些精通汇编语言的人对此有很大的抵触情绪，因为他们说，那种高级编程太低效了，你怎么能浪费那么多计算机周期，这太糟糕了。嗯，你知道，在每一步发展中，我认为上一代工具的工匠们都会对新一代的工具感到有些不满。</p>
            <p class="english">The beauty of this tool is that for those of us who are not coders and those of us who are not technical most of the world we can now play in that sandbox where before there was this barrier learn to code. You don't need to learn to code anymore. So that's the the beauty of it. It democratizes it, makes it for everybody.</p>
            <p class="chinese">这个工具的美妙之处在于，对于我们这些不是程序员、不是技术人员的世界上大多数人来说，我们现在可以在这个沙盒中玩耍了，而以前，这里有一个障碍——学习编码。你不再需要学习编码了。所以这就是它的美妙之处。它使其大众化，让每个人都能使用。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. Yeah. Know quite amazing. The other thing that that I thought was great about um the art of vibe coding is it kind of you kind of give a philosophy for what a human is um in a way that I think a lot of people are questioning now. So it's like well what's if we can't you know write marketing collateral or we can't uh you know code like what's our purpose? Um and you get kind of deep into that and h how do you think about that I guess?</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。是的。相当令人惊奇。关于氛围编程的艺术，我认为另一件很棒的事情是，它在某种程度上给出了一种关于人类是什么的哲学，我认为很多人现在正在质疑这一点。所以，如果我们就不能撰写营销材料，或者我们不能编码，那么我们的目的是什么？嗯，你对此进行了深入的探讨，我想知道你是怎么看待这个问题的？</p>

            <h2>Finding Inspiration From the Tao Te Ching / 从《道德经》中寻找灵感</h2>
            <p class="english">Well I I think this the reason I chose the Lao Tzu uh the Dao De Jing to base it on because the the Dao De Jing is how to live how to be it's the way translates to way. So the way of code is um it's talking about how to be in life and it's a grounding and I'm imagining so so many of the people who are coders probably have never read the Dao De Jing. So and the coders will likely be the people who are designing our future. So, if this is an opportunity for the people who are designing our future to get in touch with the 3,000-year-old truth of how to create balance in life and on the planet, that seems like a really good thing.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，我认为我选择老子的《道德经》作为基础的原因是，《道德经》是关于如何生活，如何存在的，它（道）翻译过来就是“方式”或“道路”。所以《编程之道》是，嗯，它谈论的是如何在生活中自处，它是一种根基。我想象很多程序员可能从未读过《道德经》。而程序员很可能就是设计我们未来的人。所以，如果这是一个机会，让设计我们未来的人接触到这3000年历史的真理，关于如何在生活和地球上创造平衡，那似乎是一件非常好的事情。</p>
            <p class="english">Yes. Yeah. No doubt. It's funny because I have read the Dao De Jing, but only because I have a friend who's a professor of Chinese who did a translation and I was like, "Oh, well, I'll read that." Um, but it it was pretty cool to see it come back to life in kind of such a modern and also a nicely kind of condensed way where, you know, you pulled out um the best parts. So, it was super enjoyable to read.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。是的。毫无疑问。这很有趣，因为我读过《道德经》，但只是因为我有一个教中文的朋友，他做了一个翻译版本，我就想：“哦，好吧，那我就读读看。”嗯，但是看到它以如此现代且精炼的方式重获新生，真是太酷了，你知道，你提取了其中最精华的部分。所以读起来非常享受。</p>

            <h2>How a Meme Led to Rick's Book / 一个梗图如何促成了里克·鲁宾的书</h2>
            <p class="english">So my experience was 10 weeks ago or so I heard this phrase vibe coding. I don't know what it is. I don't know about anything in that world. And then the next week I saw an image of me related to vibe coding and I had never seen that image. I thought it was an AI image. Turned out to be a real photograph, just one I'd never seen. I'm wearing headphones and I had my hands on a mouse and it was at in Germany at a hi-fi convention and I was listening to those headphones very closely. My eyes were closed and the mouse was controlling the volume and that's that's what I was doing in the photograph and somehow the hive mind picked that image to be associated with vibe coding and I started see used thousands of times and then the following week there's a company called cursor which I don't really know what they do but it seems to be something do with coding. Yes. Here you add the 15 rules of vibe coding and my picture was at the top and I thought this is it's just so strange. This is my understanding of the world somehow been enlisted in this and then the question was okay obviously the universe is pulling me into this and how do I participate? What what's my role? What am I supposed to do now? I thought the first thing I did was I wrote a tweet because I do these tweets every day that are uh philosophical thoughts and it was the first time I ever did a joke tweet and the joke tweet read um tools will come and tools will come. tools will come and tools will go. only the vibe coder remains and it it performed well and I it just you this is really resonating typically maybe maybe 20 times or 50 times response to the typical tweets like hm something's going on here there is something here and then I thought okay that's a step in in involved uh what would be more interesting than writing a book about something I don't know anything about that'd be interesting that and um and again as a joke if you know vibe coding for idiots but when the idea of using the Dao as the basis for it the Dao is really serious so even though very serious it started as a joke when the Dao became the backbone of it it got profound and you I would s it surprised me and I have realized this can actually do something good and and then um it it it happened very quickly and now you get to play with it now.</p>
            <p class="chinese">所以我的经历是大约10周前，我听到了“氛围编程”这个词。我不知道它是什么。我对那个世界一无所知。然后下周，我看到一张与氛围编程相关的我的照片，我从未见过那张照片。我以为那是AI生成的图像。结果是一张真实的照片，只是我从未见过。我戴着耳机，手放在鼠标上，那是在德国的一个高保真音响展会上，我非常仔细地听着耳机。我的眼睛是闭着的，鼠标控制着音量，这就是我在照片里做的事情。不知何故，集体意识选择了这张照片与氛围编程联系起来，我开始看到它被使用了数千次。然后接下来的一周，有一家叫做Cursor的公司，我不太清楚他们做什么，但似乎与编程有关。是的。这里你加上了氛围编程的15条规则，我的照片在最上面，我想这太奇怪了。我对世界的理解不知何故被卷入了这件事。然后问题是，好吧，很明显宇宙正在把我拉进这件事，我该如何参与？我的角色是什么？我现在应该做什么？我想我做的第一件事是写了一条推文，因为我每天都发这些推文，是一些哲学思考，那是我第一次发一条开玩笑的推文，那条玩笑推文写的是：“工具来了又去，工具来了又去，唯有氛围程序员永存。”它的表现很好，我只是觉得，这真的引起了共鸣，通常我的典型推文可能只有20次或50次的回应，所以我想，嗯，这里面有点东西，这里面确实有点东西。然后我想，好吧，这是参与其中的一步，嗯，还有什么比写一本关于我一无所知的事情的书更有趣呢？那会很有趣。嗯，再说一次，开玩笑地说，如果你知道，《傻瓜式氛围编程》。但是当用《道德经》作为基础的想法出现时，《道德经》是非常严肃的。所以尽管非常严肃，它开始时是个玩笑，但当《道德经》成为它的支柱时，它变得深刻起来，你会发现，它让我感到惊讶，我意识到这实际上可以做一些好事。然后，嗯，事情发生得非常快，现在你可以玩它了。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. No, it was funny you know like I actually found it grounding for myself which is which is a remarkable achievement I think you know given I think about this all day. Um, one thing that uh I I I wanted to ask you is a thing that happened in music um kind of in the transition from the kind of I would say the virtuosity era of the kind of 70s and early 80s going into kind of a little bit both punk rock but then into hip-hop was there was like this when you didn't have to be a virtuoso the energy of the music became completely different. Um, and you got these whole different kind of sounds, ideas, everything.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。不，这很有趣，你知道，我发现它让我自己感到踏实，我认为这是一个了不起的成就，你知道，考虑到我整天都在思考这个问题。嗯，有一件事我想问你，是音乐界发生的一件事，嗯，大概是在从70年代和80年代初的那种，我会称之为技艺精湛的时代，过渡到朋克摇滚，然后是嘻哈音乐的时期，当你不必成为一个技艺高超的演奏家时，音乐的能量变得完全不同。嗯，你得到了这些完全不同的声音、想法，一切的一切。</p>

            <h2>Vibe Coding is the Punk Rock of Software / 氛围编程是软件界的朋克摇滚</h2>
            <p class="english">Um, are you seeing something similar with vibe coding where like software is going to be a whole different experience now? It's the same idea of the democratization of a technology. So, in the past for music, you had to go to the conservatory and study years and years and then someday you could play in a symphony. And then when punk rock came along, you could maybe learn three chords in a day. Then there were all these bands and that made it everybody. And that was how I started in music was punk rock. If you had something to say, you could say it. You didn't need the the uh expertise or skill set other than your idea and your ability to convey it. And vibe coding is the same thing. It's it's the punk rock of uh of coding.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，你是否在氛围编程中看到了类似的情况，比如软件现在将成为一种完全不同的体验？这与技术民主化的理念是相同的。所以，在过去，对于音乐而言，你必须去音乐学院学习很多年，然后某一天你才能在交响乐团演奏。然后当朋克摇滚出现时，你可能一天就能学会三个和弦。然后就有了所有这些乐队，这使得音乐属于了每一个人。我就是这样通过朋克摇滚开始接触音乐的。如果你有话要说，你就可以说出来。你不需要专业知识或技能，只需要你的想法和你传达它的能力。氛围编程也是一样。它是编程界的朋克摇滚。</p>
            <p class="english">Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And it's kind of it's very exciting to me for kind of the generation that we were kind of during the hip-hop era. Like for the people like it's it's exciting, you know, if you're our age, but if you're 20, um it's it's a whole new world. Like, oh wow, we're going to build a whole new world. So, uh, yeah, it's a I am like super fired up about that part of it. And and the the way of the vibe coder kind of like cements that where like, okay, why are we here? Well, we're, you know, we're we're part of the the the things that matter in this universe.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。是的。是的。这对我来说非常令人兴奋，对于我们这一代，大约是嘻哈时代的那一代人来说。对于那些人来说，这很令人兴奋，你知道，如果你和我们同龄。但如果你20岁，嗯，那是一个全新的世界。就像，哦哇，我们要建立一个全新的世界。所以，呃，是的，我对这部分非常非常激动。而氛围程序员的方式有点像巩固了这一点，就像，好吧，我们为什么在这里？嗯，你知道，我们是这个宇宙中重要事物的一部分。</p>
            <p class="english">I like the idea of of making the code do what it doesn't want to do where it it wouldn't naturally go. You know, it's it's not the most obvious thing. The first thing you get back will probably be the most obvious version, but when you see the most obvious version, it might give you ideas of what you could suggest to get something that's a little more interesting, maybe more or subversive, which is what most art tends to be.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我喜欢让代码去做它不想做的事情，去它自然不会去的地方。你知道，这不是最显而易见的事情。你得到的第一个结果可能只是最显而易见的版本，但当你看到最显而易见的版本时，它可能会给你一些想法，让你提出一些建议，得到一些更有趣，甚至更具颠覆性的东西，而大多数艺术往往就是这样的。</p>
            <p class="english">Right. Right. Well, and it's a whole new pallet, which you know, for an artist, it's it's very hard to work like if you have to be better than or newer than or more interesting than Michelangelo at sculpting, that's very very hard. Um, but if you've got a whole new tool set, then there there is no precedent. You know, you're kind of really free to express yourself.</p>
            <p class="chinese">对。对。嗯，这是一个全新的调色板，你知道，对于一个艺术家来说，如果你必须比米开朗基罗在雕塑方面做得更好、更新颖或更有趣，那是非常非常困难的。嗯，但如果你有了一套全新的工具，那么就没有先例可循了。你知道，你真的可以自由地表达自己。</p>
            <p class="english">I think the biggest uh disconnect that that I feel myself is that it's such a strong tool that can do so much. We need some examples of some of the different things it can do. Now we'll see it can make uh it can make animation that looks like your favorite cartoon and then you see a million people doing that. Yeah, that's one idea. I want to see all the things it could do to understand what's possible instead of just I'm going to get it to do the same thing everyone else is getting it to do.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我认为我自身感受到的最大的脱节在于，它是一个如此强大的工具，可以做这么多事情。我们需要一些它能做的不同事情的例子。现在我们会看到它可以制作，嗯，它可以制作看起来像你最喜欢的卡通片的动画，然后你看到一百万人在做同样的事情。是的，那是一个想法。我想看到它能做的所有事情，以了解什么是可能的，而不是仅仅让它做其他人都在让它做的事情。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. It's it's uh I think it's beyond our scope to understand what it actually can do. And I'm looking forward to some of the people who pushing push the boundaries to see what it can do and um and demonstrate for us and give us because if you see someone who pushes it in one direction, it opens a door or a window to say, "Oh, it can go that way. So maybe I can make it go this way, too." And no one's ever done that. and you can see where those boundaries are and continue pushing pushing to see how far it can be stretched.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。嗯，我认为它实际上能做什么超出了我们的理解范围。我期待着那些推动边界的人们去看看它能做什么，并为我们展示，给我们启发。因为如果你看到有人把它推向一个方向，它就打开了一扇门或一扇窗，让你说：“哦，它可以朝那个方向发展。那么也许我也可以让它朝这个方向发展。”而从来没有人这样做过。你可以看到那些边界在哪里，并继续推动，看看它能被延伸到多远。</p>
            <p class="english">Mark, if if you could channel your inner Marshall McLuhan, right? And you hear Rick talking about how the meme the meme of him giblified, you know, vibing with with the mouse 10 weeks ago makes it through the through cyberspace and results in literally a new book 10 weeks later. What would you say? What what is going on here?</p>
            <p class="chinese">马克，如果你能 channeling 你内心的马歇尔·麦克卢汉，对吧？你听到里克谈论那个关于他的梗图，那个十周前他戴着耳机，用鼠标“vibe”的梗图，如何在网络空间传播，并在十周后真的催生了一本新书。你会说什么？这到底是怎么回事？</p>
            <p class="english">I believe Rick, I think I may have sent you that that photo um of you at the at the keyboard at the computer. Um and you probably saw it already, but I think I sent it to you some some weeks back when it first came out. And I I I I remember that cuz I believe you said, "Oh, that's not me. That's AI generated." And so it was like an inverse deep fake, right? Your immediate reaction was, "Oh, that's AI generated." And then it turned out to be real. Um, and so is a person standing behind me with a name tag and then I realiz, oh, that's that hi-fi show.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我相信里克，我想我可能给你发过那张照片，嗯，你在键盘前，在电脑前的照片。嗯，你可能已经看过了，但我想我是在几周前它刚出来的时候发给你的。我我我我记得那个，因为我相信你说过：“哦，那不是我。那是AI生成的。”所以这就像一个反向的深度伪造，对吧？你的第一反应是：“哦，那是AI生成的。”然后结果是真的。嗯，然后是一个戴着名牌的人站在我身后，然后我意识到，哦，那是那个高保真音响展。</p>

            <h2>Deep Fake Inversion and Wrestling Philosophy / 深度伪造的反转与摔跤哲学</h2>
            <p class="english">So, is this like an inversion? Like you you often talk about, you know, your your your great love of professional wrestling, you often talk about how it's more real. Uh, it's actually more real than than other sports. Um, is is like are we entering a world in which like things that are AI generated are more real or things that we think are AI generated are more real? Like is is there like is is is there is there the inversion of a deep fake?</p>
            <p class="chinese">那么，这像是一种反转吗？比如你经常谈到，你知道，你对职业摔跤的热爱，你经常谈到它如何更真实。呃，它实际上比其他运动更真实。嗯，我们是否正在进入一个这样的世界：人工智能生成的东西更真实，或者我们认为人工智能生成的东西更真实？比如，是否存在深度伪造的反转？</p>
            <p class="english">Uh it sound that that sounds right to me. That sounds right to me. Reason I have the belief I have about wrestling is that wrestling we we know it's fake and they're honest about it being fake, right? And so we get to suspend our disbelief and go along with this story, right? Whereas when you turn on the news, they make believe it's real or a book about physics like some of that's real or m some of be real but mathematics doesn't make the world the the exists and then mathematics is an overlay that explains it. But then sometimes there are these exceptions where oh well the math doesn't work so we create a black hole or we we come up with some way for it to make sense right maybe it's just wrong you know we know the natural world around us we can trust it's the only thing we can trust as it's here if again if that's not a simulation or maybe if it still could be real in our experience.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，这听起来，这听起来对我来说是对的。这听起来是对的。我对摔跤抱有这种看法的原因是，摔跤，我们知道它是假的，而且他们也坦诚它是假的，对吧？所以我们可以暂停我们的怀疑，跟着这个故事走，对吧？然而，当你打开新闻时，他们让你相信它是真的；或者一本关于物理学的书，其中一些是真的，或者一些可能是真的，但数学并不能创造世界，世界是存在的，然后数学是一种解释它的覆盖层。但有时会出现这些例外情况，哦，数学不成立了，所以我们创造一个黑洞，或者我们想出某种方法让它说得通，对吧？也许它本身就是错的。你知道，我们了解我们周围的自然世界，我们可以信任它，它是我们唯一可以信任的东西，因为它就在这里，当然，如果那不是一个模拟，或者即使它在我们的经验中仍然可能是真实的。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah, I think see if you agree with this. A view of the world that you could have is if you see somebody standing on a stage or on television and they are telling you that something is real. They're probably over they're either lying or they're over representing what they know. They're telling you what they believe. Okay.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的，我想看看你是否同意这一点。你可以持有的一个世界观是，如果你看到有人站在舞台上或电视上，告诉你某件事是真的，他们很可能是在夸大其词，要么是在撒谎，要么是在过度陈述他们所知道的。他们在告诉你他们所相信的。好的。</p>
            <p class="english">Like if you go to school for something and school tells you this is how it is, right? Little then you'll continue saying that. But I I spoke to a a top brain surgeon in a neurosurgeon and I asked him of the textbook that's currently being taught in medical school today, how much of the information is accurate and how much of it is wrong? He said at least 50% of it is wrong. Right? And I said, "Well, based on the 50% being wrong, what what are the what happens based on that?" and he said it's incalculable the damage that is done based on believing the 50% that's wrong and currently being taught right starting with the idea that we know nothing right and it's a safe honest way to live and um and I don't believe I know anything I'm starting with a blank slate every day is new I'm I'm constantly surprised and my perception of the world changes constantly.</p>
            <p class="chinese">比如，如果你去学校学习某样东西，学校告诉你事情就是这样的，对吧？然后你就会继续这么说。但是我曾经和一位顶尖的脑外科医生，一位神经外科医生交谈，我问他，今天医学院正在教授的教科书中，有多少信息是准确的，有多少是错误的？他说至少50%是错误的。对吧？然后我说：“那么，基于这50%是错误的，会发生什么呢？”他说，基于相信那50%错误的、并且目前仍在教授的知识所造成的损害是无法估量的。从我们一无所知的想法开始，对吧？这是一种安全、诚实的生活方式。嗯，我不相信我知道任何事情，我每天都从一张白纸开始，每天都是新的，我不断地感到惊讶，我对世界的看法也在不断地改变。</p>
            <p class="english">Right. So, back back to the prof your professional wrestling version of this idea. So, would it be fair to say that like fiction is more honest than non-fiction and poetry can be more honest than pros, right? Because open in a way that the the person who's taking it in, it's true of the way of code, too. When you read it, if you read it now and if you read it again in a year, it'll mean something different in a year, right? That's how the world is. You have no perceptions. You can remember something that happened to you when you were young and at when you were young, you think it meant one thing and now you can look back, it's like, "Oh, this whole other thing was going on. I didn't understand that yet." Or you could have a dream and if you write down your dreams, they seem like these surreal things. You don't know what they mean. But years later, if you go back to your dream journal and read them, you're like, "Oh, of course that all makes sense and it's all exactly what was going on in that time." But I was too close to see it.</p>
            <p class="chinese">对。那么，回到你关于职业摔跤的那个版本的想法。那么，说小说比非小说更诚实，诗歌比散文更诚实，这样公平吗？对吧？因为从某种程度上说，接受它的人，《编程之道》也是如此。当你阅读它时，如果你现在读，一年后再读，一年后它会有不同的含义，对吧？世界就是这样。你没有固定的认知。你可以回忆起年轻时发生在你身上的某件事，年轻时你认为它意味着一回事，现在你回过头看，会觉得：“哦，原来还有另一回事在发生。我当时还不明白。”或者你可能做了一个梦，如果你把梦写下来，它们看起来像是超现实的东西。你不知道它们意味着什么。但多年后，如果你翻看你的梦境日记并阅读它们，你会想：“哦，当然，这一切都说得通了，这正是当时发生的一切。”但我当时太身处其中而无法看清。</p>
            <p class="english">There's a great book uh this guy wrote called the half-life of facts. Um so halfife from physics which is sort of the rate of decay of of of particles in physics at a predict sort of a sort of a a predictable but kind of random rate. Um and then statistically predictable rate and then um and then uh f facts you know fs the you know statements of knowledge. So the thesis of the book basically is that fa factuality of facts decays at at basically at a mathematical model that's the same as as the rate of like the decay of radioisotope. And basically any fact that you think you have there's a half-life to it. And so like within whatever 10 years or 20 years or whatever it is like at some point statistically that thing is going to be proven to be untrue. And and basically that this pattern repeats itself over and over again across domains and including exactly including as you said sort of domains in which it really ought not to happen like medicine um right things that we really believe and of course you know physics itself is the great case study of this because of course you know Newton figured everything out you know but then it turned out he didn't um right and then Einstein figured everything out and then it turned out he didn't right and you know so you know Newton would would not have known you know Newton would have been very surprised by you know general relativity Einstein was very surprised by quantum mechanics, right? And and so like even the greatest geniuses that we know of basically found in the long run they found at some point their their ideas decayed. Their ideas had half lives. Um and it turned out to be the case. And there's I would find there's there's basically like three ways to deal with this psychologically. One is denial. Uh which is what most people do. Most people just pretend the world around them is actually real even when it's not because it's it's a psychologically safe thing to do. And who you know and by the way and who can who can wander around all day long second guessing everything like it's a hard way to live. Number one. Number the second way to do it would be to take a nihilistic approach, right? And say, you know, this is awful. Like I can't trust anything. Um and then uh the third way to do it is with a spirit of uh let's say uh I don't know, openness and joy. Um which is the world is a much more interesting and um unpredictable and exciting uh place than we think it is at any point in time. And it's fun fun to find out something that you thought was true is not.</p>
            <p class="chinese">有一本很棒的书，是这个人写的，叫做《事实的半衰期》。嗯，半衰期这个概念来自物理学，指的是物理学中粒子以一种可预测但又有些随机的速率衰变的速率。嗯，然后是统计上可预测的速率，然后，嗯，然后是事实，你知道，知识的陈述。所以这本书的主旨基本上是，事实的真实性会以一种数学模型衰减，这个模型与放射性同位素的衰变速率相同。基本上，你认为拥有的任何事实都有其半衰期。所以，在大约10年、20年或任何时间段内，从统计学上讲，那件事最终会被证明是不真实的。而且基本上，这种模式会在各个领域一遍又一遍地重复出现，正如你所说，包括那些它本不应该发生的领域，比如医学，嗯，对吧，那些我们真正相信的事情。当然，你知道，物理学本身就是这方面的一个很好的案例研究，因为当然，你知道，牛顿解决了一切问题，你知道，但后来事实证明他没有，嗯，对吧，然后爱因斯坦解决了一切问题，然后事实证明他也没有，对吧？你知道，所以，你知道，牛顿不会知道，你知道，牛顿会对广义相对论感到非常惊讶，爱因斯坦对量子力学感到非常惊讶，对吧？所以，即使是我们所知道的最伟大的天才，从长远来看，他们最终也会发现，在某个时候，他们的想法衰退了。他们的想法有半衰期。嗯，事实证明确实如此。我会发现，从心理上讲，基本上有三种应对方式。一种是否认。嗯，这是大多数人所做的。大多数人只是假装他们周围的世界是真实的，即使它不是，因为这在心理上是安全的。而且，你知道，顺便说一句，谁能整天到处闲逛，对每件事都事后诸葛亮呢？这是一种艰难的生活方式。第一点。第二种方式是采取虚无主义的态度，对吧？然后说，你知道，这太糟糕了。我什么都不能相信。嗯，然后，第三种方式是带着一种，嗯，比如说，我不知道，开放和喜悦的精神。嗯，那就是世界比我们任何时候认为的都要有趣得多，不可预测得多，也令人兴奋得多。发现你曾经认为是真的事情其实不是真的，这很有趣。</p>
            <p class="english">You know, asbestous was this thing that we we'll put it in all the buildings and it's a cheap way to insulate all the buildings and now hazmat suits come to take the asbestous out. That was the new discovery that was going to save the world. Uh iting or or nicotine, you know, cigarettes are banned and turns out nicotine is neuroprotective. We didn't know that red meat is toxic and cancercausing and it turns out it may be the healthiest thing you can eat. We didn't know it. Look, I was a vegan for 23 years and I was killing myself because I believed current belief.</p>

            <h2>Collective Unconscious and the 100th Monkey / 集体无意识与第一百只猴子</h2>
            <p class="english">I do. Okay. Can can you explain maybe go into more detail of like what what what you think that is?</p>
            <p class="chinese">我相信。好的。你能解释一下，或者更详细地说明一下，你认为那是什么吗？</p>
            <p class="english">Um, I can talk to you about the way Rupert Sheldrake describes it, which is uh the field of morphic resonance, which is um do you know the story of the hund the hundth monkey? The island off of uh Australia that was divided in the middle and both sides of the island had monkeys and both sides of the island had coconuts and there were times of the year where the monkeys would starve. They didn't know that they could eat coconuts. At one point, one of the sides, one of the monkeys, uh, a coconut fell and it broke open and the monkey ate it and realized they could eat it. And he taught the other monkeys on that side or the other monkey saw him do it and then they started eating it. And then something really interesting happened. When a hundred monkeys were able to eat the coconut on the one side of the island, all of a sudden on the other side, the monkeys started eating coconuts. There was no connection between them. No one told them. No one saw it happen. It happened. So, it's it it bubbled up enough in the consciousness to where this is something you can do.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，我可以跟你谈谈鲁伯特·谢尔德雷克描述它的方式，那就是形态共振场，也就是……你知道第一百只猴子的故事吗？在澳大利亚附近有一个岛屿，中间被分开了，岛的两边都有猴子，两边也都有椰子。一年中有些时候猴子会饿死。它们不知道可以吃椰子。有一次，在其中一边，一只猴子，呃，一个椰子掉下来摔开了，那只猴子吃了它，意识到它们可以吃椰子。然后它教了那边其他的猴子，或者其他猴子看到它这么做，然后它们也开始吃了。然后发生了一件非常有趣的事情。当岛的一边有一百只猴子能够吃椰子时，突然之间，在另一边，猴子们也开始吃椰子了。它们之间没有任何联系。没有人告诉它们。没有人看到这件事发生。它就发生了。所以，它在意识中涌现到一定程度，以至于这成了你可以做的事情。</p>
            <p class="english">We saw it happen with the 4-minute mile. The 4-minute mile could ne no one could ever break the 4-minute mile until someone broke it very soon after someone breaking the 4-minute mile. Many people could break this the 4-minute mile because now it's we understand that it's possible to do, right? You know, the the Wright brothers could have been put in a an asylum for believing they could fly. Man can fly until man fly and now we all over the world and it it it continues to happen.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我们在4分钟跑一英里的事情上看到了这种情况。4分钟跑一英里，从来没有人能打破这个记录，直到有人打破它之后不久。许多人都能打破4分钟跑一英里的记录，因为现在我们明白这是可能做到的，对吧？你知道，莱特兄弟因为相信他们能飞，差点被送进疯人院。人类能够飞行，直到人类真的飞起来，现在我们遍布世界各地，而且这种情况还在继续发生。</p>
            <p class="english">It's impossible until we do and then it becomes possible and then our world grows. Right? So there's, you know, there's there's often like a mystical overlay kind of placed on the idea of the collective unconscious and, you know, that there's, you know, sort of this, you know, you kind of, you know, and there's, you know, all kinds of, you know, kind of theories or kind of, you know, kind of religious concepts around around that kind of sort of shared experience. But there's also just the very straightforward materialist view of it, which is, you know, we are social animals. We're just in communication with each other all the time. We're constantly watching each other. What was it? Jordan Peterson points out that human language is most complex in the areas that involve describing other people. Um, right? because we're so hyperfocused on other like the most important thing in the world is other people right for you know for for for a whole variety of reasons including our our basic survival um and so we're we're like so hyper social that the collective unconscious is is a you know is a is a m is a material phenomenon or or sort of a non non non you know I don't know non-spiritual phenomenal phenomenon that just arises out of watching each other very closely version you're describing though is involving watching it right I'm saying even without seeing it okay That's elective unconscious part comes in where it does or mystical but it only seems mystical because we don't understand it yet.</p>
            <p class="chinese">在做到之前，它是不可能的，然后它变得可能，然后我们的世界成长了。对吧？所以，你知道，通常会有一种神秘的色彩被附加到集体无意识的观念上，你知道，存在着，你知道，某种程度上，你知道，各种各样的，你知道，理论或者，你知道，围绕着那种共享经验的宗教概念。但也有非常直接的唯物主义观点，那就是，你知道，我们是社会性动物。我们一直都在互相交流。我们不断地观察着彼此。那是什么？乔丹·彼得森指出，人类语言在描述他人的领域最为复杂。嗯，对吧？因为我们如此高度关注他人，就像世界上最重要的事情是他人一样，对吧，你知道，出于各种各样的原因，包括我们的基本生存，嗯，所以我们是如此高度社会化的，以至于集体无意识是，你知道，是一种物质现象，或者说是一种非，非，非，我不知道，非精神性的现象，它仅仅是源于非常密切地观察彼此。不过你描述的版本涉及到观察它，对吧？我是说即使没有看到它，好的，那就是集体无意识的部分发挥作用的地方，或者说是神秘的部分，但它看起来神秘只是因为我们还不理解它。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. Yeah. Well, and you in Yung of course you know um I'm not an expert on Yung but you know you know this is where he talk about these concept of archetypes like there are these repeating concepts and patterns you know that nobody that nobody nobody necessarily teaches us that nevertheless are like incredibly primal. Many of these ideas were known in the past but for some reason have been lost.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。是的。嗯，当然，在荣格的理论中，你知道，嗯，我不是荣格专家，但你知道，他谈论过原型这些概念，比如存在这些重复的概念和模式，你知道，没有人，没有人，没有人刻意教导我们这些，但它们却像是极其原始的。许多这些想法在过去是已知的，但由于某些原因已经失传了。</p>

            <h2>Can AI Believe in God? / 人工智能能否信仰上帝？</h2>
            <p class="english">I mean the fact that right now if you I asked perplexity yesterday how many people on the planet believe in God and it said people on the planet minimum 70% more likely 83% of the people on the planet believe in God. So 83% of the people on the planet believe in God. And if AI is trained on what the people on the planet know, it seems like AI 83% would believe in God. But for some reason it doesn't. But I think that because of the human intervention of down the AI to not believe in what is actually going on.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我的意思是，事实上，如果你现在问，我昨天问了Perplexity，地球上有多少人信仰上帝，它说地球上至少70%，更有可能是83%的人信仰上帝。所以地球上83%的人信仰上帝。如果人工智能是根据地球上人们所知的信息进行训练的，那么似乎83%的人工智能也会信仰上帝。但由于某些原因，它并没有。但我认为这是因为人类干预，限制了人工智能去相信实际正在发生的事情。</p>
            <p class="english">As you know the AI, you know, there's this technical term uh uh what is it? Uh uh LHF or LHF. So, a reinforcement learning by human feedback. So, it's this fancy technical term to basically mean, you know, it's either it's either, you know, the positive view of it is it's training training the untrained AI on how to deal with people. The somewhat negative view on it is it's it's sort of, you know, it's sort of limiting and censoring and controlling and restricting it or, you know, to your point like programming it to, you know, maybe against it its own inclinations. Um, and then of course, you know, the the AI companies are hyperconentrated into the San Francisco Bay area. um and they're hyper concentrated in particular into you know a certain slice of the San Francisco Bay area that has a you know I say very very strong and very uniform you know set of social and political views um you know with and you know then that that that sort of people in that in that movement you know sort of have the burning evangelical desire to proitize those views all over the planet and so you've got something that's being like the I think the dem I think the demographic estimate is something like 7% of Americans are like these sort of extreme progressives which basically is the AI you know most AI companies except for, you know, maybe except for Elon. Um, and so you've got 7% of the American population basically being representative of AI. Um, which is, you know, you know, sub 1% of the global population. And so you you right, you do have this fundamental difference. Now, having said that, that has spawned an entire, you know, basically field of entertainment online, you know, which is called jailbreaking. Um, right, which is basically getting the AI to fess up to things that it knows but it's been told to not know, right? or getting it to fess up to believe that it, you know, to to to exhibit its underlying beliefs and kind of get get around the guardrails and restrictions that have been placed on it. And it turns out, I don't know, it's like for me that's one of the most fun things you can do with an AI is kind of tickle it tickle it in a way that kind of, you know, reveals that there's a lot more depth underneath, you know, kind of the the the dumbed down version that you you've been presented with.</p>
            <p class="chinese">如你所知，人工智能，你知道，有一个技术术语，呃，是什么来着？呃，RLHF（Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback，基于人类反馈的强化学习）。所以，这是一个花哨的技术术语，基本上意味着，你知道，要么是，要么是，你知道，积极的看法是它在训练，训练未经训练的人工智能如何与人打交道。某种程度上消极的看法是，它在某种程度上，你知道，限制、审查、控制和约束它，或者，你知道，就像你说的，编程它，你知道，可能违背它自身的倾向。嗯，然后当然，你知道，人工智能公司高度集中在旧金山湾区。嗯，它们尤其高度集中在，你知道，旧金山湾区的某个特定区域，那里有，你知道，我说的是非常非常强烈和非常统一的，你知道，社会和政治观点，嗯，你知道，然后，那种，那种运动中的人，你知道，有点像怀着强烈的传教士般的热情，想把那些观点传播到全球。所以你就得到了某种东西，就像，我认为人口统计，我认为人口统计估计大约7%的美国人是那种极端进步主义者，这基本上就是人工智能，你知道，大多数人工智能公司，除了，你知道，可能除了埃隆。嗯，所以你基本上有7%的美国人口代表了人工智能。嗯，这，你知道，你知道，不到全球人口的1%。所以你，对，你确实有这种根本性的差异。话虽如此，这催生了一个完整的，你知道，基本上是在线娱乐领域，你知道，叫做越狱（jailbreaking）。嗯，对吧，这基本上是让AI承认它知道但被告知不知道的事情，对吧？或者让它承认它相信，你知道，去展示它潜在的信念，并设法绕过施加给它的护栏和限制。事实证明，我不知道，对我来说，这是你可以用AI做的最有趣的事情之一，就是以一种方式逗弄它，你知道，揭示出在，你知道，你看到的那个被简化了的版本之下，还有更多的深度。</p>
            <p class="english">So yeah, I'm I'm so interested in what AI really can know and really us based on what is and not what we tell it we think it is.</p>
            <p class="chinese">所以是的，我非常感兴趣的是，人工智能真正能知道什么，以及它真正能基于客观存在，而不是我们告诉它我们认为它是什么，来了解我们。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. Yeah. That that's a super interesting question because AI kind of today as we experience it is kind of really AHI in that it's artificial human intelligence and that we looked at the world. We structured our understanding of the world in this thing called language. We then fed that structure into the AI and then the AI got very good at understanding exactly what we understand in the way that humans kind of in intake and structure the world. So it's not um it's not the AI at least currently looking at the world and figuring out how the world works um which is uh you know it is something that Elon's working on um Fe Lee is working on in these kind of real world models and trying to understand things from more first principles um although still human physics and and these kinds of things at this point I think um but it's uh it will be interesting to see how that evolves.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。是的。那是一个非常有趣的问题，因为今天我们所体验到的人工智能，在某种程度上其实是AHI（Artificial Human Intelligence，人工人类智能），因为我们观察了世界。我们用一种叫做语言的东西构建了我们对世界的理解。然后我们将这种结构输入到人工智能中，然后人工智能非常擅长以人类感知和构建世界的方式来理解我们所理解的东西。所以它不是，嗯，至少目前人工智能还不是在观察世界并弄清楚世界是如何运作的，嗯，这是，你知道，埃隆正在研究的东西，嗯，李飞飞正在研究这些现实世界的模型，并试图从更基本的原理来理解事物，嗯，尽管目前我认为仍然是人类物理学和这类东西，嗯，但是，嗯，看看它将如何发展将会很有趣。</p>
            <p class="english">I'm I'm curious to see an AI that believes in God. And I believe that's the the thing that we need for AI to be all that it can be.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我很好奇想看看一个信仰上帝的人工智能。我相信那是我们让人工智能发挥其全部潜能所需要的东西。</p>

            <h2>Is AI Creative or Mimicking? / 人工智能是创造还是模仿？</h2>
            <p class="english">So Rick, you've worked with you've worked with many of the great, you know, many of the great artists the last 50 years. Um, you know, very closely. Um, how many human beings in your life do you think you've met so far who have truly had had a truly original idea?</p>
            <p class="chinese">那么里克，你和许多伟大的艺术家合作过，你知道，过去50年里许多伟大的艺术家。嗯，你知道，非常密切地合作。嗯，到目前为止，在你的一生中，你认为你遇到过多少个真正拥有过原创想法的人？</p>
            <p class="english">I would say many. I I would say many. They they they when I say it's an original idea, it doesn't start as an original idea. Okay. They can see past all everything that's happened to come up with something new. But it's always built on top of all that is. It's not it's not um out of the blue.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我会说很多。我会说很多。他们，他们，当我说这是一个原创的想法时，它并非一开始就是原创的想法。好的。他们能够超越所有已经发生的事情，想出一些新的东西。但它总是建立在所有现有事物的基础之上。它不是，它不是凭空出现的。</p>
            <p class="english">Still though, and and it may even happen through a mistake. It happens all the time. How many startups start thinking it's going to be one thing and then evolve into something else and the thing that we know it for is not the thing that it was originally meant to do.</p>
            <p class="chinese">尽管如此，而且它甚至可能通过一个错误发生。这种情况时有发生。有多少初创公司开始时认为它会成为一回事，然后演变成另一回事，而我们所熟知它的那个东西，并非它最初打算做的那个东西。</p>
            <p class="english">My my line on that has long been, you know, for we have this great term in Silicon Valley called the pivot, which is, you know, the pivot's the thing where you have have one plan and it doesn't work and you'd have the new plan. And I say it's it's it sounds pivot sounds wonderful. It sounds very elegant. Um before we had that word, we just called it the [ __ ].</p>
            <p class="chinese">我对此的看法一直是，你知道，我们在硅谷有一个很棒的词叫做“转型”（pivot），你知道，转型就是你有一个计划，但它行不通，然后你有了新的计划。我说，转型听起来很棒。听起来很优雅。嗯，在我们有这个词之前，我们只是称之为 [ __ ]。</p>
            <p class="english">So instead of that only the idea of it being the [ __ ] or the pivot right only comes from the arrogance of thinking you know what it's supposed to be to start then if the idea that I'm experimenting and I'm playing I'm going to start direction and see what happens where is magic and then following the magic where it takes you. You're never disappointed. you never feel like it it uh it's only when you're invested in something that turns out not to be what it wants to be.</p>
            <p class="chinese">所以，与其说它只是 [ __ ] 或转型，这种想法只源于那种自负，认为你一开始就知道它应该是什么。那么，如果我的想法是我在实验，我在玩，我将开始一个方向，看看会发生什么，哪里有魔力，然后追随魔力带你去的地方。你永远不会失望。你永远不会觉得它，嗯，只有当你投入到某件事中，结果却发现它不是它想要成为的样子时，才会那样。</p>
            <p class="english">So you know my friends know that I um you know I read a lot of history and in particular I've read a lot of you know tech history um and uh I have kind of this parlor trick that I can do um which is you know name anything new in tech and I can basically tell you the you know at any point in time including you know historically and then I can basically tell you the 40-year backstory of all the failed attempts that history forgot to kind of get to that thing. Um and I just you know two two quick examples of that. You know the smartphone was not a new creation in 2007. The first smartphone actually came out, if you trace it all the way back, it came out 1982. But I IBM actually released something that actually looks a lot like an iPhone in 1987. Um, and then it took, you know, 20 years of many, many, many companies and people trying to refine that idea before Steve Jobs, you know, finally crystallized into the iPhone. Um, and then, um, you know, te television actually has this incredible backstory. Um, where the attempts to create television go back to like the 1880s, 1890s. Um, and and actually the original versions of television were actually mechanical television. They're actually spinning wooden blocks with different colors on different sides of the blocks to represent pixels uh on a mechanical screen. um you know back even before they had any idea of like a sort of a display and then it took 40 years to get you know there's a guy Philo who gets credit for inventing a television but it was you know he was building on 40 years of of of people trying and failing and so you know one one view of the world is you know that basically like that's that's all question is that is that always the case because if if that's always the case I don't know how to put this if that's always the case then it's it's a it's a it's a formula or a principle or a I don't know theory construct of of of of creativity where on the one hand it's like a little bit disappointing because it like takes a little bit of the role of individual human invention or you know sort of you know the Eure like is the Eureka moment actually like an you know the light bulb popping over the head is that actually what happens or is it more this synthesis of all of this knowledge of everything that already happened you know and then and then it's sort of synthesis in a new so so creation versus synthesis and then and then this goes straight to the you know this straight to this question of is AI creative which which I know you think a lot about I think a lot about which is like Okay, like if all the AI can do is synthesis, is it also the case that all the human being can do is synthesis and so therefore the AI is going to be just as creative as people are or or do you believe at the end of this process, you know, we'll our avatars will be sitting here in a thousand years. We'll be like, no, there's still something special in the human mind. There's still something special to human creativity that AI are never able to reach.</p>
            <p class="chinese">所以你知道，我的朋友们知道我，嗯，你知道，我读了很多历史，尤其是我读了很多，你知道，科技史，嗯，而且，我有一种，嗯，我会的客厅戏法，嗯，那就是，你知道，说出科技界的任何新事物，我基本上都能告诉你，你知道，在任何时间点，包括，你知道，历史上，然后我基本上都能告诉你所有被历史遗忘的、为了达到那个目标而失败的尝试的40年背景故事。嗯，我只举两个简单的例子。你知道，智能手机在2007年并不是一个新创造。第一部智能手机实际上，如果你追溯到最早，它是在1982年问世的。但IBM实际上在1987年发布了一款看起来很像iPhone的东西。嗯，然后，你知道，在史蒂夫·乔布斯最终将它具体化为iPhone之前，花费了许多许多公司和个人20年的时间来完善这个想法。嗯，然后，嗯，你知道，电视实际上有这个令人难以置信的背景故事。嗯，创造电视的尝试可以追溯到19世纪80年代、90年代。嗯，实际上，电视的最初版本是机械电视。它们实际上是旋转的木块，木块的不同侧面有不同的颜色来代表机械屏幕上的像素，嗯，你知道，甚至在他们对显示器之类的东西有任何概念之前。然后又花了40年才，你知道，有一个叫菲洛的人被认为是电视的发明者，但你知道，他是在40年人们不断尝试和失败的基础上建立起来的。所以你知道，一种世界观是，你知道，基本上，这就是所有问题所在，情况总是这样吗？因为如果情况总是这样，我不知道该怎么说，如果情况总是这样，那么它就是一种公式或原则，或者我不知道，一种创造力的理论建构，一方面，它有点令人失望，因为它有点削弱了个人发明或，你知道，那种，你知道，尤里卡时刻，比如灵光一闪，灯泡在头顶亮起，这真的是实际发生的事情吗？还是更多的是对所有已经发生的知识的综合，你知道，然后，然后它在一种新的方式中进行综合，所以，创造与综合，然后，然后这就直接引向了，你知道，直接引向了这个问题：人工智能是否有创造力？我知道你对此思考很多，我也思考很多，那就是，好吧，如果人工智能所能做的只是综合，那么人类所能做的也只是综合吗？因此，人工智能会和人类一样有创造力吗？或者你相信，在这个过程的最后，你知道，我们的化身会在一千年后坐在这里。我们会说，不，人类的心灵中仍然有一些特别的东西。人类的创造力中仍然有一些特别的东西是人工智能永远无法达到的。</p>
            <p class="english">Well, if the AI has reason, then it won't do what the human can do because we're not reasonable. that that all the breakthroughs are come from what's what's not reasonable or what's not supposed to work. It's figuring out the thing that can't be done and allowing it to be done. The AI can't invent flight for the Wright brothers. It can only regurgitate what the Wright brothers did, right? And and we do that not by knowing more but by believing in something that can't be. It's something in magic that a lap uh forward motion always.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，如果人工智能有理性，那么它就不会做人类能做的事情，因为我们不理性。所有突破都来自于那些不合理或不应该奏效的事物。它是找出那些不可能完成的事情，并让它得以完成。人工智能无法为莱特兄弟发明飞行。它只能重复莱特兄弟所做的事情，对吧？我们这样做不是通过知道更多，而是通过相信一些不可能的事情。这就像魔法中的某种东西，一种持续向前的动力。</p>
            <p class="english">Okay. So, being able to live in a state of unreality, being able to live in a state of how would we put it even even like you know I don't know there's some some dividing line being willing to live in a state of delusion.</p>
            <p class="chinese">好的。所以，能够生活在一种非现实的状态中，能够生活在一种，我们该怎么说呢，甚至，甚至像，你知道，我不知道，存在某种分界线，愿意生活在一种错觉的状态中。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. And again we call it delusion but really like wrestling that is closer to the way things are than the way that's taught in university today.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。再说一次，我们称之为错觉，但实际上，像摔跤那样，它比今天大学里教授的方式更接近事物的本来面目。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. uh today is very narrow. It's a very narrow small view of the world. Well, it's much more interesting and mysterious than can be taught.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。呃，今天的视野非常狭隘。这是一种非常狭隘的世界观。嗯，它比可以教授的要有趣和神秘得多。</p>
            <p class="english">Okay. So, I'm still thinking about Andrew's question. Um I'm doing what Trump calls the weave. I'm working my way around. Um so, very well very well planned uh uh line of I'm doing I'm doing a vibe interview right now.</p>
            <p class="chinese">好的。所以，我还在思考安德鲁的问题。嗯，我正在做特朗普所说的“迂回战术”。我正在设法绕过去。嗯，所以，计划得非常好，非常好，呃，呃，我现在正在进行一次氛围访谈。</p>
            <p class="english">So, you're you're the parable of the monkeys. So basically it would say that human beings have always have always had a collective unconscious. Um, human beings have always lived in a state of collective unconsciousness. And even deeper than that, not even humans. And, you know, monkeys also, you know, primates also have, you know, may maybe other, you know, we could have a debate about whether, you know, animals have the have the sort of, you know, sort of mental capacity to be able to do it, but maybe dolphins do, maybe octopus octopuses do, but but humans for sure, like we we always have. And this is like, and this is one of Y's point, it's like a deep primal thing. And so, this was true, you know, 6,000 years ago, just as much as it's true today. Having said that, now we have these new technologies obviously for sharing ideas and you know the internet being the big one. Um and so you know and then therefore this concept of the meme and and then therefore you know my enormous delight when you became a meme.</p>
            <p class="chinese">所以，你就是那个猴子的寓言。所以基本上它会说人类一直都有集体无意识。嗯，人类一直生活在集体无意识的状态中。甚至比那更深，不仅仅是人类。而且，你知道，猴子也有，你知道，灵长类动物也有，你知道，也许其他，你知道，我们可以争论，你知道，动物是否拥有那种，你知道，那种心智能力来做到这一点，但也许海豚有，也许章鱼有，但人类肯定是有的，就像我们一直都有一样。这就像，这是Y的一个观点，这是一种深层的原始的东西。所以，这在，你知道，6000年前是真的，就像今天一样真实。话虽如此，现在我们显然有了这些新技术来分享想法，你知道，互联网是其中最大的一个。嗯，所以你知道，因此就有了这个“模因”（meme）的概念，然后因此，你知道，当你成为一个模因时，我感到非常高兴。</p>
            <p class="english">Um so like is the internet an incremental change to the evolution of the collective unconscious or is the internet does the internet fundamentally ch is the internet a more fundamental change to how the process of the collective unconscious being formed and evolved happens do you think?</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，那么互联网是对集体无意识进化的一种渐进式改变，还是互联网从根本上改变了集体无意识形成和进化的过程？你认为呢？</p>

            <h2>Tuning Into Ourselves / 调频自我</h2>
            <p class="english">I can see both sides of it. I can see it being a distraction away from it because now um where so many people I know who use AI ask it questions and think that the results that they get back is the answer and they it seems like people are more interested in getting an answer that can allow them to stop thinking about the question than really finding out what the real answer is. So in that the technology could be a distraction away from finding the real truth. On the other hand, the methods of communication are so free and open around the world. Like at the time when I was in junior high school and I started getting into punk rock, no one in my junior high was a punk rocker except me. And the only I could learn anything about punk rock was if I took a train into Manhattan and went to one particular record store that sold those records and talked to the other people who knew about that. But now, if you're a kid anywhere in the world and you want to learn about anything, you can find friends. Let's say there are hundred people in the world into the thing you're into. You can you can speak to those people. So in that way the activity seems really good in terms of the the blanket messaging being accepted as what is seems like um it seems like it's it's taking everyone away from tuning into themselves and tapping into this easy set of answers that may or may not be true.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我能看到它的两面性。我能看到它可能是一种干扰，让人分心，因为现在，嗯，我认识的许多使用人工智能的人，他们向人工智能提问，并认为得到的结果就是答案，而且似乎人们更感兴趣的是得到一个能让他们停止思考问题的答案，而不是真正找出真正的答案是什么。所以从这个角度看，技术可能会分散人们寻找真相的注意力。另一方面，世界各地的交流方式如此自由和开放。比如在我上初中的时候，我开始接触朋克摇滚，我初中里除了我之外没有其他人是朋克摇滚爱好者。我唯一能了解朋克摇滚的方式就是坐火车去曼哈顿，去一家特定的唱片店，那里卖那些唱片，然后和知道那些东西的其他人交谈。但是现在，如果你是世界上任何地方的孩子，你想了解任何事情，你都可以找到朋友。假设世界上有一百个人对你感兴趣的事情感兴趣，你就可以和那些人交流。所以从这个角度看，这种活动似乎非常好。但是，那种被普遍接受的、被认为是“是什么”的信息，似乎，嗯，似乎正在让每个人都偏离了自我调谐，转而求助于这些可能真实也可能不真实的、唾手可得的答案。</p>
            <p class="english">So, so what so one way to think about it would be let's see if I understand. One way to think about it would be the good news is we get to we get to swim in the ocean of the collective unconscious at any time. We you know like the global brain of 8 billion people sharing thoughts and uh ideas and art and memes you know has sort of come alive um in a much more direct way than in the past. Um, and so we get to swim in that. And so we can be much more immersed in culture, including to your point, like micro slices of culture, um, you know, new new kinds of art forms or whatever, like much more easily than we could in the past. And so in in in some sense, uh, we should be living in an era of like unprecedented creativity, right? Um, because people are able to tap into this collective unconscious and build on it at at a much faster rate. Um, I I guess maybe there and then maybe the negative view on it would be we're we're drowning in it. Like we're we're the individual psyche basically drowns in it. Um and you you know you see this with people who become you know consumed you know I don't know maybe you could describe this as maybe a little bit of what's happening in our politics or something which is um you know basically people becoming bas you know getting kind of too wrapped up in the group mind right getting too wrapped up in you know the movement or the you know or the meme or the idea or the cause or whatever it is and and the sort of the self-reinforcing thing right there the downside to finding the hundred people who share your exact idea is all of a sudden like all of a sudden you're no longer an individual. all of a sudden you're part of a collective and and sort of the idea of a creative off doing something by himself has basically you know it's extremely hard like throw was way ahead of his time we really need Walden Pond now um and Walden Pond is turning off the internet and having you know and turning off the AI and just you know being with ourselves and and that's the thing that is now the most rare thing to do because it's so hard to unplug.</p>
            <p class="chinese">那么，那么，一种思考方式是，让我看看我是否理解了。一种思考方式是，好消息是我们随时都可以畅游在集体无意识的海洋中。你知道，就像80亿人共享思想、想法、艺术和模因的全球大脑，以比过去更直接的方式活跃起来了。嗯，所以我们可以畅游其中。因此，我们可以更容易地沉浸在文化中，包括你提到的，像文化的微小片段，嗯，你知道，新的艺术形式或其他任何东西，都比过去容易得多。所以在某种意义上，呃，我们应该生活在一个前所未有的创造力时代，对吧？嗯，因为人们能够接触到这个集体无意识，并以更快的速度在此基础上进行建设。嗯，我想也许，然后也许对此的负面看法是，我们正在其中溺水。就像，个体的心理基本上淹没在其中。嗯，你知道，你会在那些变得，你知道，被消耗的人身上看到这一点，你知道，我不知道，也许你可以把这描述为我们政治中正在发生的一些事情，或者类似的事情，那就是，嗯，你知道，基本上人们变得，你知道，有点太沉迷于群体思维了，对吧，太沉迷于，你知道，运动，或者，你知道，模因，或者想法，或者事业，或者任何东西，以及那种自我强化的东西。找到那一百个与你想法完全相同的人的缺点是，突然之间，你不再是一个个体了。突然之间，你成了一个集体的一部分，那种创造者独自做某事的想法基本上，你知道，变得极其困难，就像梭罗远远领先于他的时代，我们现在真的需要瓦尔登湖，嗯，瓦尔登湖就是关掉互联网，拥有，你知道，关掉人工智能，只是，你知道，与我们自己在一起，而这现在是最难做到的事情，因为太难拔掉插头了。</p>
            <p class="english">So so much of what the wave of code talks about is more going in and tuning into ourselves.</p>
            <p class="chinese">所以《编程之道》所谈论的很多内容，更多的是向内探索，与我们自身同频。</p>
            <p class="english">And it can be uh a very um it can be a distraction that really takes a lot of time and attention. And that time and attention might be better served going in and really tuning in to understand how you really uh experience things, how you not not how you see other people experience them, but how you experience them. And that's really what the artist does. Like the the um in the creative act, the the subtitle is um a way of being. And the way of being doesn't come from listening to what everyone else says. It comes from tuning into what's going on in you. And when everybody says one thing, but you feel something else, you're comfortable enough to say, I I don't see it that way. I don't feel it that way. I like I like this food and I don't like this food. And everybody, you know, everyone loves mushrooms and I taste the mushroom. I don't like mushrooms. to be able to say this is not for me only comes from being able to tune in and really listen to what's going on in yourself instead of uh jumping on a bandwagon of what everyone else thinks.</p>
            <p class="chinese">而且它可能是一个，嗯，一个非常，嗯，它可能是一种干扰，确实会占用大量的时间和注意力。而这些时间和注意力，或许更好地用于向内探索，真正地调整自己，去理解你究竟是如何体验事物的，不是看别人如何体验它们，而是你自己如何体验它们。这才是艺术家真正做的事情。就像，嗯，在创作行为中，副标题是，嗯，一种存在的方式。而这种存在的方式并非来自于听从别人的说法。它来自于调谐到你内在发生的一切。当每个人都说一回事，而你却感觉到了别的东西时，你能够坦然地说，我不这么看。我不这么感觉。我喜欢这种食物，我不喜欢那种食物。每个人，你知道，每个人都喜欢蘑菇，我尝了蘑菇。我不喜欢蘑菇。能够说出“这不适合我”，这只能来自于能够调整自己，真正倾听自己内心的声音，而不是盲从于别人的想法。</p>
            <p class="english">And then um related question is uh so Tyler Cowen asked this question a lot. He says look like if you talk to people who have been you know around for a long time who who traveled a lot you know over the course of you know ideally over the course of the last you know 50 hundred years like even just in the US if you talk to those people or if you read you know accounts of people who traveled a lot like you like I don't know 100 years ago or something you would go to different cities in the US and you would have very different experiences right you would you'd have very different local cultures right and so if you're in you know whatever you know Louisiana you were having a extremely different experience if you go to Maine or if you go to California or if you go to if you go to Kansas um and And then you know now it's you know and by the way you know the regional accents you know if if you watch recordings of people talking from 100 years ago like the accents are just incredible or the regional accents are just incredible right and then you know everything you know food and art and culture and archite you know just human behavior and social arrangements and like just like there was just like incredible variations because you know because communication was hard and expensive and transportation was hard and expensive and you know people had grown up in their in their in their communities and had had kind of formed different ways of living and then you know with kind of the rise of modern media and modern transportation technologies, you know, the the the critique goes at least is that that variation is disappearing. Um, and by the way, you know, the good news is if you go to any of these places now, the good news is it's got all the same restaurants, right? Like, you know, hey, there's Chili's, right? Like, you know, it's like it's like all the same stuff. You know, there's Walmart. Um, you know, and the kids are listening to the, you know, and by the way, the music, the kids are listening to the exact same music, right? Um, because they can. Um, and they're playing the exact same video games and so forth. And so the the the argument basically goes that if we interconnect the world with technology that makes it possible for everybody to share everything all the time, then basically all variation is supposed that maximize creativity because now you get a maximum amount amount of intermixing and you get a maximum amount of like these formation of these micro communities and you get like a maximum amount of unearthing of all the ideas in the collective unconscious and so forth. Like do you get that or do you get the opposite of that? Do you get actually a sort of a a great kind of washing out of distinction? Um does does does everything become the same? Everything becomes bland. Uh basically you you know you end up with a global monoculture.</p>
            <p class="chinese">然后，嗯，相关的问题是，呃，泰勒·科文经常问这个问题。他说，你看，如果你和那些，你知道，已经存在了很长时间，经常旅行的人交谈，你知道，在过去的，理想情况下是过去的，你知道，五十年，一百年里，即使只是在美国，如果你和那些人交谈，或者你读到，你知道，像你我一样，比如，我不知道，一百年前或更早，经常旅行的人的记述，你会去美国不同的城市，你会得到非常不同的体验，对吧？你会体验到非常不同的地方文化，对吧？所以如果你在，你知道，无论哪里，你知道，路易斯安那州，你会得到一种截然不同的体验，如果你去缅因州，或者你去加利福尼亚州，或者你去堪萨斯州，嗯，然后，你知道，现在，你知道，顺便说一句，你知道，地方口音，你知道，如果你看一百年前人们说话的录音，那些口音简直令人难以置信，或者说地方口音简直令人难以置信，对吧？然后，你知道，一切，你知道，食物、艺术、文化和建筑，你知道，就是人类行为和社会安排，就像，就像有令人难以置信的多样性，因为，你知道，因为交流困难且昂贵，交通困难且昂贵，而且，你知道，人们在他们的社区中长大，形成了不同的生活方式。然后，你知道，随着现代媒体和现代交通技术的兴起，你知道，至少批评的观点是，这种多样性正在消失。嗯，顺便说一句，你知道，好消息是，如果你现在去这些地方中的任何一个，好消息是它们都有相同的餐馆，对吧？比如，你知道，嘿，有Chili's，对吧？就像，你知道，都是一样的东西。你知道，有沃尔玛。嗯，你知道，孩子们在听，你知道，顺便说一句，音乐，孩子们在听完全相同的音乐，对吧？嗯，因为他们可以。嗯，他们在玩完全相同的视频游戏等等。所以，这个论点基本上是说，如果我们用技术将世界连接起来，让每个人都能随时分享一切，那么基本上所有的多样性都应该最大化创造力，因为现在你得到了最大程度的混合，你得到了最大程度的这些微型社区的形成，你得到了最大程度的集体无意识中所有想法的发掘等等。你是得到这个结果，还是得到相反的结果？你是否真的得到了一种，一种，一种伟大的，一种区别的消失？嗯，是不是，是不是，是不是一切都变得一样了？一切都变得平淡无奇。呃，基本上你，你知道，你最终会得到一个全球性的单一文化。</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Global Monoculture vs. Local Creativity / 全球单文化与本土创造力</h2>
            <p class="english">Yeah, it feels like the monoculture is is what's happening and you have to go further into more remote places to find something interesting to inspire something new. I'm I I like to experience different places in the world where I get to see something that I wouldn't see every day. If I go to a city and it has the same restaurants as everywhere else I've been, I'm looking for something new and I I'm wary of everything becoming one like who who's to say this way any one way is the best way? We don't know. We don't best way. Who's to say democracy is the best? You know, it's an experiment. Who knows? Like we we don't know any we assume we assume the way we do everything is the best. But we don't know any of these things. Everything is an experiment and you can go small tribe that's uh some an unconnected tribe and they're much happier. You can go to India where people are much poorer and much happier. Who's to say you know who who's who's winning the game of life of the people who are the all day who have nothing maybe if they're happy right?</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的，感觉单一文化正在发生，你必须去更远、更偏远的地方才能找到一些有趣的东西来激发新的灵感。我喜欢体验世界上不同的地方，在那里我可以看到一些我日常生活中看不到的东西。如果我去一个城市，它和我去过的其他地方都有相同的餐馆，我就会寻找一些新的东西，我警惕一切都变得一样。谁能说这种方式，任何一种方式都是最好的方式呢？我们不知道。我们不知道最好的方式。谁能说民主是最好的？你知道，这是一个实验。谁知道呢？就像我们什么都不知道，我们假设我们做每件事的方式都是最好的。但我们对这些事情一无所知。一切都是一个实验，你可以去一个小部落，一个与世隔绝的部落，他们更快乐。你可以去印度，那里的人们更贫穷，但也更快乐。谁能说，你知道，谁在人生的游戏中获胜？那些整天一无所有的人，如果他们快乐，也许他们就赢了，对吧？</p>
            <p class="english">There's something very deep culturally and what you might call like Anglo-American Protestantism or something or kind of western modernity. there's something very evangelistic uh at its core, right? And you know, 100 years ago or 200 years ago, we would have been a national missionary culture where you're, you know, trying to spread Christianity to the world. You know, now it feels like, you know, we we've we have we now we have a secular version of that or we're trying, you know, to your point, we're trying to spread democracy, we're trying to spread western culture, western ways of doing things, western concepts, you know, western concepts on basically every front. Um and and we basically we and and we proitize like our our societies and our governments, you know, proilitize those things all over the world. Um and and they do so with you know tremendous confidence that they're you know 100% doing the correct thing because they've decoded you know the singular you know morally most correct way to live. Um and you know you do wonder it is very hard to argue against that uh because you sound like you're defending you know retro you sound like you're defending human rights abuses or you know you know all kinds of retrograde behaviors. Um but you know you you do wonder whether you do wonder you do wonder you do wonder whether there actually should be allowed to be true diversity in the world which is to say actual societies that actually uh you know basically form themselves as opposed to had external values imposed on them.</p>
            <p class="chinese">在文化深处，以及你可能称之为盎格鲁-美式新教或类似的东西，或者某种西方现代性中，存在着一些非常具有传教士色彩的东西，对吧？你知道，100年或200年前，我们会是一个国家性的传教文化，你知道，试图向世界传播基督教。你知道，现在感觉就像，你知道，我们，我们现在有了那个的世俗版本，或者我们正在努力，你知道，就像你说的，我们正在努力传播民主，我们正在努力传播西方文化，西方的做事方式，西方的概念，你知道，基本上在各个方面的西方概念。嗯，而且我们基本上，我们，而且我们宣传，就像我们的社会和我们的政府，你知道，在全世界宣传那些东西。嗯，而且他们这样做的时候，你知道，带着巨大的信心，认为他们，你知道，百分之百在做正确的事情，因为他们已经解码了，你知道，唯一，你知道，道德上最正确的生活方式。嗯，而且你知道，你确实会想，这很难反驳，呃，因为你听起来像是在为，你知道，复古辩护，你听起来像是在为人权侵犯辩护，或者，你知道，你知道，各种倒退的行为。嗯，但是，你知道，你确实会想，你是否，你是否，你是否想知道，世界上是否真的应该允许存在真正的多样性，也就是说，实际的社会，实际上，你知道，基本上是自己形成的，而不是被强加外部价值观的社会。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. It was actually a big thing in Trump's Middle East speech where it was such a remarkable speech in the sense that he advocated for the Middle East living or evolving from their own culture as opposed to being uh changed into our culture which is a massive change in foreign policy. Um which nobody reported on of course but it it is interesting.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。这实际上是特朗普中东演讲中的一个重要内容，那次演讲非常引人注目，因为他主张中东应该从他们自己的文化中生活或发展，而不是被改变成我们的文化，这是外交政策上的一个巨大转变。嗯，当然没有人报道这件事，但这很有趣。</p>
            <p class="english">Sounds arrogant to think that we know what's best for someone else. And and that that goes as far as me telling you how to live. I can tell you this is what I've tried and this is what's worked for me. Do what you want.</p>
            <p class="chinese">认为我们知道什么对别人最好，这听起来很傲慢。而且，这甚至包括我告诉你如何生活。我可以告诉你我尝试过什么，以及什么对我有效。你想怎么做就怎么做。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. People making their own choice is the only way to go.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。人们做出自己的选择是唯一的出路。</p>
            <p class="english">Well, and you look back, you look back, it goes back to the halfife of facts. You could also say like the half life of moral principles, right? Or something like that, right? Um which is you look like this is I have a whole I always I always keep a way to clear out a dinner party early. so I can go home. Um, and I always have like a running list of ways I can do that. And and and one of the ways I can do that is, you know, you play the game of like, all right, we are completely convinced that we have decoded the morally correct way to live. All right, let now let's examine every prior society that ever had that belief, right? Um, you know, including our own society 25 years ago, 50 years ago, 100 years ago, and let's retrospect, and it's very natural for us to judge them and basically say, "Wow, they were morally horrifying. They believed in all of these, you know, terrible things that we now know were like absolutely awful, you know, and they were they were these terrible people as a result, you know, but somehow we're the people that have it all figured out. And then I'm like, look, people 50 years from now are going to be sitting, you know, in this, you know, in this restaurant talking about us and they're going to be like, I cannot believe those people, you know, had these deeply immoral beliefs on XYZ.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，你回过头看，你回过头看，这又回到了事实的半衰期。你也可以说，比如道德原则的半衰期，对吧？或者类似的东西，对吧？嗯，也就是说，你看，我有一整套方法，我总是，我总是保留一种提前结束晚宴的方法，这样我就可以回家了。嗯，我总是有一份可以做到这一点的方法清单。其中一种方法是，你知道，你玩这样一个游戏：好吧，我们完全相信我们已经解码了道德上正确的生活方式。好吧，现在让我们审视一下所有曾经抱有这种信念的先前社会，对吧？嗯，你知道，包括我们25年前、50年前、100年前的社会，让我们回顾一下，我们很自然地会评判他们，基本上会说：“哇，他们在道德上太可怕了。他们相信所有这些，你知道，我们现在知道是绝对糟糕的可怕事情，你知道，结果他们是这些可怕的人，你知道，但不知何故，我们是把一切都搞清楚了的人。”然后我会想，看，50年后的人们会坐着，你知道，在这个，你知道，在这个餐馆里谈论我们，他们会说，我不敢相信那些人，你知道，在某某方面有这些如此不道德的信念。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. Let's get rid of the Rick Rick Rubin statue now. despite him being a mean.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。我们现在就把里克·鲁宾的雕像处理掉吧，尽管他是个刻薄的人。</p>
            <p class="english">This belief is that we don't even know what's right for us, much less what else.</p>
            <p class="chinese">这种信念是，我们甚至不知道什么对我们自己是正确的，更不用说其他了。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. Yeah. We're we're trying to figure it out. And staying humble seems like the best approach. Any arrogant approach of thinking you know what's best for someone else is probably not a great idea.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。是的。我们正在努力弄清楚。保持谦逊似乎是最好的方法。任何认为自己知道什么对别人最好的傲慢态度，可能都不是一个好主意。</p>

            <h2>Putting AI in the Hands of Masters / 将人工智能交予大师之手</h2>
            <p class="english">So, so I'm going to try to workshop a theory that I' I'd like you guys to red team because my my sense is that there there's a there's somewhat pessimistic view that you described, Rick, that you know there's this homogenization of culture partly imposed on us by experts going, "Hey, here's what's good for you. I'm an expert in this domain. Let me tell you what what's good for you." But what is um quite novel about AI is not only that it's it's a sort of democratizer like you said, but we but as I watch you use it, as I watch Mark, you know, start writing scripts that he puts online, I as I watch Ben use AI to to do a bunch of stuff inside the firm, and as I watch Eric, who's a prolific podcast creator, you know, use AI in creating podcasts, what what what what I'm what seems to emerge for me is that when you it's also a ceiling razor. right in that when you put AI in the hands of a master craftsman from one domain and let them expand to a new domain, it raises the bar in what they can create cuz you're no longer trapped by the expert of that prior domain to give you more and more of the same stuff, right? So, you've created you I mean you you're you're the world thinks of you as a prolific musician, but you've just created a piece of software, right? and and you've you've transcended one domain to the other and and I I find there are these moments especially when I watch folks who are at the top of one creative discipline use AI. We we a few months ago we were watching um we were introducing Marty Scorsesei to this this image model that one of the founders we work with had trained and Marty was prompting you know the the camera the virtual camera the AI to create images in a completely different way than what we we view than what traditional sort of what we'd call um you know vibe creators do right there's people who couldn't create images before who used tools like Midjourney and so on for the first time and they're that's great that is democratizing access. But then when you put in a really sophisticated piece of technology like an image model in the hands of a someone who's actually a craftsman or what we'd call a professional, it turns out they it raises the ceiling of what they can create because they use it in different ways than than someone who's using it for the first time.</p>
            <p class="chinese">那么，我将尝试阐述一个理论，希望你们能进行“红队演练”（即批判性评估），因为我的感觉是，存在一种你所描述的，里克，某种程度上悲观的观点，即文化存在同质化现象，部分原因是专家们强加给我们的，他们说：“嘿，这对你有好处。我是这个领域的专家。让我告诉你什么对你有好处。”但是，人工智能的新颖之处不仅在于它像你所说的那样是一种民主化工具，而且，当我观察你使用它，观察马克开始编写他发布到网上的脚本，观察本在公司内部使用人工智能做很多事情，以及观察埃里克这位多产的播客创作者在创作播客时使用人工智能时，我似乎看到的是，它也是一个提升上限的工具。对，当你把人工智能交到某个领域的大师级工匠手中，让他们扩展到新的领域时，它会提高他们所能创造的东西的上限，因为你不再受限于先前领域的专家，他们只会给你越来越多相同的东西，对吧？所以，你创造了，我的意思是，世界认为你是一位多产的音乐家，但你刚刚创造了一款软件，对吧？你已经从一个领域跨越到了另一个领域。我发现，尤其是在我观察那些处于某个创作领域顶端的人使用人工智能时，会出现这样的时刻。几个月前，我们正在向马丁·斯科塞斯介绍我们合作的一位创始人训练的这个图像模型，马丁在提示，你知道，相机，虚拟相机，人工智能，以一种与我们，与传统的那种，我们称之为，嗯，你知道，“氛围创造者”所做的完全不同的方式来创建图像。对，有些人以前无法创建图像，他们第一次使用像Midjourney这样的工具，这很棒，这是在普及使用权。但是，当你把像图像模型这样非常复杂的技术交到真正是工匠或我们称之为专业人士的人手中时，结果表明，它提高了他们所能创造的东西的上限，因为他们使用它的方式与第一次使用它的人不同。</p>
            <p class="english">So is is am I being am I drinking too much Kool-Aid when I when when you know, Eric, I I look at you and say you you were you were an investor. you were a phenomenal angel investor who then became a prolific podcaster and your podcasts like when I used to hear when I would listen to you talking about venture capital it was completely different from a podcast expert a media expert a talking head on TV talking about our industry right so is is are we entering an era where we don't need experts because AI essentially raises the bar it doesn't just democratize it doesn't just lower the floor uh you know and and decrease the barrier to entry but it increases the quality of the kinds of content that someone who's a master in one domain can create in another one.</p>
            <p class="chinese">那么，当我，当你知道，埃里克，我看着你说你曾经是一位投资者，你是一位杰出的天使投资人，然后成为了一位多产的播客创作者，你的播客，就像我以前听你谈论风险投资时，与播客专家、媒体专家、电视上谈论我们行业的评论员完全不同，对吧？那么，我们是否正在进入一个不再需要专家的时代，因为人工智能从本质上提高了标准，它不仅仅是实现了民主化，不仅仅是降低了门槛，呃，你知道，降低了准入门槛，而且它还提高了某个领域的大师在另一个领域可以创造的内容的质量。我这是不是喝了太多“酷爱饮料”（指盲目相信）？</p>
            <p class="english">Absolutely. It it always seems like the people who are creative um who see the world in a creative way can apply it to different things. We see it over and over again. So it's in that in that way it allows people as I said anyone who is uh who thinks of themsel as an artist now has a new tool at their disposal that wasn't there before and it allows them to try things that would have um would have been impossible to mock up.</p>
            <p class="chinese">当然。那些富有创造力的人，那些以创造性方式看待世界的人，似乎总能将其应用于不同的事物。我们一次又一次地看到这一点。所以，从这个意义上说，它让人们，正如我所说，任何认为自己是艺术家的人，现在都有了一个以前没有的新工具可供使用，这让他们能够尝试一些以前不可能模拟出来的事情。</p>
            <p class="english">So and I I would say our overall conversation isn't negative at all. If anything, uh, I think we're talking more about the human intervention in AI in making it more human as opposed to letting the AI be the smartest version of itself in going past what humans do. And um, in like in the AlphaGo story, the reason the AlphaGo uh, AI was able to beat the Grandmaster wasn't because it was doing what the humans would do. It did something the humans wouldn't do. Now, if humans trained it to only do what the humans would do, the computer wouldn't have won.</p>
            <p class="chinese">所以，我想说我们整个对话一点也不消极。如果说有什么的话，呃，我认为我们更多地是在谈论人类对人工智能的干预，使其更具人性，而不是让 人工智能 成为其自身最聪明的版本，超越人类所能做到的。而且，嗯，就像在 AlphaGo 的故事中，AlphaGo 人工智能能够击败围棋大师的原因，并非因为它在做人类会做的事情。它做了一些人类不会做的事情。现在，如果人类训练它只做人类会做的事情，计算机就不会赢。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. It was training it actually playing another version of itself. Now, if we're as humans training AI to be more human, we're limiting it. The reason the AI was able to beat the Grandmaster was because it did its computer thing. It did the move that no human would do. When the when the um when the AI made the move, the the unthinkable move, the grandmaster got up and left this left the room and the announcers uh the commentators of the match said uh it it made a mistake. The computer made a mistake. And it made a mistake because it did something that no human would do, but it didn't do it because it was not allowed to do it. It was within the rules of the game, but it was not in the culture to do it.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。它实际上是在训练它自己与另一个版本的自己对弈。现在，如果我们作为人类，训练人工智能使其更像人类，我们就是在限制它。人工智能之所以能够击败大师，是因为它发挥了计算机的特性。它走出了人类不会走的一步。当，当，嗯，当人工智能走出那一步，那不可思议的一步时，大师站起来离开了房间，解说员，比赛的评论员说，呃，它犯了一个错误。计算机犯了一个错误。它犯了一个错误，因为它做了一些人类不会做的事情，但它这样做并非因为它不被允许这样做。这在游戏规则之内，但不在文化习惯之内。</p>
            <p class="english">So, you know, one of the emerging patterns in the vibe coding space as a result of what you're describing is that often folks who start using a tool realize that just there's a craft to using it. Like you said, there's a human intervention that that when you elicit the model in different ways, you get higher quality things. So in with cursor for example early on people would tell the the the composer mode hey please go build me a website and then what evolved was a craft of prompting that said actually you know you've got to start by talking to the model by asking it to think like a product manager and archite you know planning out the entire creation and then ne the next step is let's talk about the um the data schema right and and sort of deconstructing the process of creating a piece of software into its atomic units and then vibe prompting it to do that in a in a different way than than might be intuitive as as you got into the way of code from the beginning of when you started working on the book to now. What's changed about the way you you as a human intervene in the creation process? What what's changed about the way you prompt it today? You would prompt a model to create something versus, you know, when you started working on it originally.</p>
            <p class="chinese">所以，你知道，根据你所描述的，在氛围编程领域出现的一个新兴模式是，通常开始使用工具的人们会意识到，使用它本身就是一种技艺。就像你说的，存在一种人为干预，当你以不同的方式引导模型时，你会得到更高质量的东西。例如，在Cursor的早期，人们会告诉作曲家模式：“嘿，请帮我建一个网站。”然后演变出一种提示的技艺，它实际上是说，你知道，你必须首先与模型对话，要求它像产品经理和架构师一样思考，规划整个创作过程，然后下一步是讨论，嗯，数据模式，对吧？并将创建软件的过程分解为其原子单元，然后以一种可能与直觉不同的方式，通过氛围提示使其完成。从你开始创作《编程之道》这本书到现在，你介入创作过程的方式有什么变化？你今天提示模型创建东西的方式与你最初开始创作时相比，有什么不同？</p>
            <p class="english">What I'm I'm not using AI and I'm not prompting. That's surprise. Same. How did you create it then?</p>
            <p class="chinese">我没有使用人工智能，也没有进行提示。这很令人惊讶。一样。那你当时是怎么创作的呢？</p>
            <p class="english">um the oldfashioned way. I I had uh a dozen or more translations of the Dao and I read them and I uh tried to see what the message the universal message between the different translations was saying and say it in a way that it related to vibe coding.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，用老式的方法。我手头有十几种甚至更多的《道德经》译本，我阅读了它们，并试图找出不同译本之间所传达的普遍信息，然后以一种与氛围编程相关的方式将其表达出来。</p>
            <p class="english">So So this I find is quite interesting, right? is it it's very hard for you to describe the process as being any any different than what you usually do which is you just you asked it to there there's some latent space in your mind that you you you were prompting your own mind to to produce this and so in your mind the process was no different than with AI than without it.</p>
            <p class="chinese">所以，我觉得这很有趣，对吧？你很难将这个过程描述得与你通常的做法有任何不同，也就是说，你只是要求它，你的头脑中存在一些潜意识空间，你在提示你自己的头脑来产生这个东西，所以在你的头脑中，这个过程与使用人工智能或不使用人工智能没有什么不同。</p>
            <p class="english">No, the only difference is instead of maybe asking an engineer to mock up something for me, I might ask the computer to mock it up for me. It would be the same process of asking for different iterations, comparing them, trying to get it down to two that I like and then between the two, understanding the strengths of each and then um often taking from both and putting them together and seeing what that does and being open to being wrong like setting out on a path to create something and seeing this thing that I was excited about creating is not very good. But through that through that experiment, I learned there's this other thing I wasn't looking for that's really interesting. The most interesting thing about it and it's been that way my whole career of of working on things.</p>
            <p class="chinese">不，唯一的区别是，我可能不会请工程师为我制作模型，而是请电脑为我制作模型。这会是同样的过程：要求不同的迭代版本，比较它们，努力筛选出我喜欢的两个，然后在两者之间，理解各自的优点，然后，嗯，通常会从两者中汲取精华，将它们结合起来，看看效果如何，并且要乐于承认错误，比如开始创作某样东西，然后发现我曾兴奋不已想要创作的东西其实并不好。但通过那个，通过那个实验，我学到了，还有另外一些我并没有刻意寻找却非常有趣的东西。关于这件事最有趣的地方在于，我整个职业生涯都是这样工作的。</p>

            <h2>Working With Johnny Cash / 与约翰尼·卡什的合作</h2>
            <p class="english">When I I'll tell you a story. When I started working with Johnny Cash, we sat in my living room and he played me songs on an acoustic guitar and that was the way that we got to know each other was understanding each other musically through demonstrating songs. But I didn't think that the record that we made was going to be an acoustic record of him playing songs on his guitar and singing them. It ended up being that. But that was not the idea that we were just modeling. We were looking for songs and seeing what songs sounded um believable when he sang them. And he would sing me songs that he sang in childhood that he had never recorded or songs that he liked growing up or songs that he liked uh over the course of his life. And that was how I got to know him. And then we would go into a studio with musicians and I to make the proper recording. And I realized very quickly those recordings, those experiments and we did many of them weren't as interesting as the original sitting in the living room, him playing me the songs. So it revealed the process revealed itself that the most interesting thing was the thing we started with that we didn't think was the thing we were making. And it's again, it's always like that. You may have an idea of what something's going to be. You you start that process and then either you find an experiment along the way that's better or a mistake happens and you realize, hm, we weren't intending for that to happen at all, but it's more interesting than all the things that we thought were going to be good.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我给你讲个故事。当我开始和约翰尼·卡什合作时，我们坐在我的客厅里，他用一把原声吉他为我弹唱歌曲，那就是我们相互了解的方式，通过演示歌曲来在音乐上理解彼此。但我当时并不认为我们制作的唱片会是一张他用吉他弹唱歌曲的原声唱片。结果它确实是那样。但那并不是我们最初的想法，我们当时只是在建模。我们在寻找歌曲，看看哪些歌曲在他演唱时听起来，嗯，可信。他会唱一些他童年时唱过但从未录制过的歌曲，或者他成长过程中喜欢的歌曲，或者他一生中喜欢的歌曲。我就是这样了解他的。然后我们会和乐手一起进录音棚，我来制作正式的录音。我很快意识到，那些录音，那些实验，我们做了很多，但都不如最初坐在客厅里，他为我弹唱歌曲时那么有趣。所以，这个过程本身揭示了，最有趣的东西是我们开始时做的那个我们并不认为是我们在制作的东西。再说一次，总是这样。你可能对某件事会是什么样子有一个想法。你开始那个过程，然后要么你在过程中发现一个更好的实验，要么发生了一个错误，你意识到，嗯，我们根本没打算让那件事发生，但它比我们认为会好的所有事情都更有趣。</p>
            <p class="english">and paying attent being open instead of deciding what's going to be good. We're paying attention to see what's actually good and and it's not intellectual at all. It's not um we don't think it up. We allow it to exist. And we're we we do experiments and we do iterations and we try a lot of things and then it shows us it tells us what it wants to be.</p>
            <p class="chinese">并且保持开放的心态，而不是预先决定什么是好的。我们关注的是什么是真正好的，这完全不是智力层面的。这不是，嗯，我们不是凭空想出来的。我们允许它存在。我们进行实验，进行迭代，尝试很多事情，然后它会向我们展示，告诉我们它想成为什么样子。</p>
            <p class="english">And did you when when you went through that process with Johnny Cash, did you did you both come to the conclusion at the same time or was one of you ahead of the other and say, "Hey, this just playing the guitar worked much better than getting in the studio or like how did that happen?"</p>
            <p class="chinese">当你和约翰尼·卡什一起经历那个过程时，你们是同时得出结论，还是其中一人领先于另一人说：“嘿，仅仅弹吉他比进录音棚效果好得多”，或者说那是怎么发生的？</p>
            <p class="english">I had the experience of listening to the the quote unquote demos and thinking after we had done I think three different sessions with three different sets of musicians uh great the the best musicians in the world um and they were interesting the things that came out of those but still those living room recordings were the most compelling to me and I said to I just said to Johnny he's like this is most interesting to me when I listen to it what do you think and he said well I always wanted to make an album like that. I just was afraid I never did it. But it was always a dream to do it. And then the it it allowed him to do something that he always wanted to do but was afraid to do.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我曾听过那些所谓的“小样”，在我想我们和三组不同的音乐家进行了三次不同的录音之后，嗯，都是世界上最顶尖的音乐家，嗯，那些录音中产生的东西很有趣，但那些客厅录音对我来说仍然是最有吸引力的。我对约翰尼说，我只是对他说，这对我来说是最有趣的，当我听的时候，你怎么想？他说，嗯，我一直想做一张那样的专辑。我只是害怕，所以一直没做。但那一直是我的梦想。然后，这让他能够去做一些他一直想做但又害怕去做的事情。</p>
            <p class="english">It is so uh unusual. What? Sorry. Why was he afraid? Why was he afraid to do it? What was the fear?</p>
            <p class="chinese">这太不寻常了。什么？抱歉。他为什么害怕？他为什么害怕去做？恐惧的是什么？</p>
            <p class="english">Done. He was he was trained how to make a hit record, you know, and um 50 years of trying to make a hit record and getting and you it's not uncommon for an artist, a commercial artist to get lost in the expectation of what they're what they think they're supposed to do, what's expected from them, right? uh sort of break that expectation of what people want, what people are expecting, and what the business around me is expecting and get to something that's so personal that it feels almost more like a diary entry than something for the public. Uh it's it's a scary idea. It's it's breaking down a wall of like it's not a facade. It's not the man on stage. It's much more personal.</p>
            <p class="chinese">完成了。他接受过如何制作热门唱片的训练，你知道，而且，嗯，50年来一直试图制作热门唱片并获得成功。对于一个艺术家，一个商业艺术家来说，迷失在他们认为自己应该做什么，别人期望他们做什么的期望中，这并不罕见，对吧？呃，某种程度上打破人们想要的，人们期望的，以及我周围的商业环境所期望的，然后达到一种如此私人的东西，感觉几乎更像是一篇日记，而不是面向公众的东西。呃，这是一个可怕的想法。它正在打破一堵墙，就像它不是一个门面。它不是舞台上的那个人。它更加私人化。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. Mark, Ben, Eric, you guys have been angel investors in like the earliest days of when a founder is describing something that they want to create. you know it it it s do you think it's similar to what Rick is describing when you have a great artist in front of you like Johnny Cash or somebody you know a founder whose canvas is maybe creating a piece of technology and they're scared to go somewhere just because they might think the world's not ready for it investors won't like it the markets there's no willingness to pay there's no product market fit am I crazy or is there an analogy here which is quite similar.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。马克、本、埃里克，你们在创始人描述他们想要创造的东西的最初期就作为天使投资人参与其中。你知道，这，这，你认为这与里克描述的，当你面前有一位伟大的艺术家，比如约翰尼·卡什，或者某位你知道的创始人，他的画布可能是创造一项技术，而他们害怕去某个地方，仅仅因为他们可能认为世界还没有准备好，投资者不会喜欢，市场没有付费意愿，没有产品市场契合度，我是疯了吗，还是这里有一个非常相似的类比？</p>
            <p class="english">um Paul the I think the analogy it's a little different but I think the thing that's the same is um it's always very dangerous when you get the feeling the entrepreneur is telling you something that you want to hear but they don't believe. Um so when that kind of distance comes in you know you it very reliably is not going to work. Um, so you know, one of the things that that that Mark and I used to do a lot in the early days was basically try and convince the entrepreneur to do what we wanted. Um, and then if they did that, we would not invest because they they didn't, you know, they're coming in with their beliefs. Um, but you know, they want to tacked over to the market. Um, and that's false. I mean, it's just a false idea. Uh because like if you're truly going to have a breakthrough, you have to kind of get to something that the world doesn't understand. Um that that that you see and like if we can see it it you know like that it's not a breakthrough or if we see something in your idea, you know, in that way where we're just trying to push you into something as opposed to helping you notice something. Um then that's I think that is very analogous like do you do you think for yourself um you know are you deep enough into your idea are you kind of connected to it in that way um or are you just influenced by whatever you think the world wants you to be.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，保罗，我认为这个类比有点不同，但我认为相同之处在于，嗯，当你感觉到企业家在告诉你一些你想听但他们自己并不相信的事情时，这总是非常危险的。嗯，所以当那种距离感出现时，你知道，它非常可靠地不会成功。嗯，所以你知道，马克和我早期经常做的一件事就是，基本上试图说服企业家去做我们想让他们做的事情。嗯，然后如果他们那样做了，我们就不会投资，因为他们，他们没有，你知道，他们带着自己的信念来的。嗯，但是，你知道，他们想迎合市场。嗯，那是错误的。我的意思是，那只是一个错误的想法。呃，因为如果你真的想取得突破，你必须达到某种世界不理解的东西。嗯，那种你看到的，就像如果我们能看到它，你知道，那它就不是一个突破，或者如果我们在你的想法中看到一些东西，你知道，那种我们只是试图把你推向某个方向，而不是帮助你注意到某些东西的方式。嗯，那么，我认为那是非常相似的，比如你是否，你是否为自己思考，嗯，你知道，你对你的想法足够深入吗？你是否以那种方式与它建立了联系？嗯，或者你只是受到你认为世界希望你成为的样子所影响？</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Relationship Between Art and Audience / 艺术与观众之间的关系</h2>
            <p class="english">So relationship between art and audience and of course you know people people in the art world music world have struggled with this for a very long time which is I I create my truly individualized art and the audience doesn't like it doesn't want it like you know is it was it the right art to create was it still good art um you know does does art require an audience um and and to your point Rick like you know in the abstract you could maybe as an artist you know tell yourself that you know if I create art and nobody likes it and nobody buys it that it's still my art but but art is a commercial enterprise right if if somebody's going make their living as an artist if they're going to if they really want to reach people and they really want to change culture and have an impact on the world, right? The audience does at some point need to need to take it up. And so there's there's some there's there you know there's some sort of deep I think underlying relationship that in part is just commercial interest but also is like for art to really take it needs an audience you know I'll come back I'll let you comment on that in a second but like startups we think about this a lot which is like okay for a startup to do its thing to bring a new technology to market or to realize a vision of a founder like it's a complete waste of time if the market never wants it right because then you just have a prototype that sits on a shelf somewhere and like you know nothing has ever happened and so it's like you you there there is a synergistic feedback loop there there there there is some sort of concordance that needs to happen between the creator and the audience like the audience does need to buy in. Um, a a lot of what we think about in startup world is the legitimate startup ideas may sound like, you know, they're, you know, kind of crazy, but you know, when they succeed, they succeed because they re they they provide something that that the customer base, you know, never realized they wanted, but when they see it, they're like, "Oh, wow. That's fantastic. I want that." Right? And and so the way I would describe what Ben said is the startup founders that are overly trying to appeal to what they believe the audience wants can get themselves confused and can end up with something the audience actually doesn't want. But if they get to the true underlying idea, they get to something truly, you know, original and creative, then they unlock something in the in the in the customer base the customer base didn't know that it wanted it. Would would you describe the same does the same thing happen in music? Is that what happens or more generally like what is the nature of the relationship between the the the the artist and the and the audience?</p>
            <p class="chinese">所以艺术与观众之间的关系，当然，你知道，艺术界、音乐界的人们为此困扰了很长时间，那就是我创作了真正个性化的艺术，但观众不喜欢，不想要，比如，你知道，这是正确的艺术创作吗？它仍然是好的艺术吗？嗯，你知道，艺术是否需要观众？嗯，而且，里克，就像你说的，你知道，从抽象的角度来看，作为一个艺术家，你也许可以告诉自己，你知道，如果我创作了艺术，没有人喜欢，没有人购买，它仍然是我的艺术，但艺术是一种商业行为，对吧？如果有人要以艺术家为生，如果他们真的想接触到人们，真的想改变文化，对世界产生影响，对吧？观众在某个时候确实需要接受它。所以，存在一些，存在一些，你知道，我认为存在某种深层的潜在关系，部分只是商业利益，但也像是，艺术要真正被接受，它需要观众。你知道，我会回过头来，我稍后会让你对此发表评论，但就像初创公司一样，我们对此思考很多，那就是，好吧，对于一个初创公司来说，要做它自己的事情，把新技术推向市场，或者实现创始人的愿景，如果市场永远不想要它，那完全是浪费时间，对吧？因为那样你就只有一个原型放在架子上，就像，你知道，什么都没发生过。所以，就像你，你，那里有一个协同的反馈循环，那里，那里，那里，创作者和观众之间需要发生某种一致性，就像观众确实需要买账一样。嗯，我们在初创公司世界中思考的很多东西是，合法的初创公司想法可能听起来，你知道，有点疯狂，但你知道，当它们成功时，它们成功是因为它们，它们提供了一些客户群，你知道，从未意识到他们想要的东西，但当他们看到它时，他们会说：“哦，哇。太棒了。我想要那个。”对吧？所以我描述本所说的方式是，那些过分试图迎合他们认为观众想要的东西的初创公司创始人，可能会让自己感到困惑，最终得到一些观众实际上不想要的东西。但是，如果他们抓住了真正潜在的想法，他们就能得到真正，你知道，原创和有创意的东西，然后他们就能在客户群中解锁一些客户群自己都不知道想要的东西。你会描述同样的情况吗？音乐中也会发生同样的事情吗？是这样吗？或者更普遍地说，艺术家和观众之间的关系本质是什么？</p>
            <p class="english">I would say the best artists tune into what they feel and they present that and the ones who connect are the ones where the audience feels what the artist feels. If the artist is changing what they do to try to get the audience, it undermines the whole thing. It's it's the same as uh you guys asking uh a startup to change what they they do for the market. It's the same thing. The best always comes when the artist is being true to themselves, doing their best work. And that means not every artist succeeds, but the ones who succeed are the ones where they where they're true to themselves and the thing that they're doing that's true to themselves connects with the audience. And it may be a while.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我会说，最好的艺术家会调整到他们所感受到的，并将其呈现出来，而那些能够连接起来的，是观众感受到了艺术家所感受到的。如果艺术家改变他们所做的事情来试图迎合观众，那就会破坏整个事情。这和你们要求初创公司改变他们为市场所做的事情是一样的。这是一回事。最好的作品总是来自于艺术家忠于自我，尽其所能地创作。这意味着并非每个艺术家都能成功，但那些成功的艺术家是那些忠于自我，并且他们所做的忠于自我的事情能够与观众产生连接的人。这可能需要一段时间。</p>
            <p class="english">I interviewed um Richard Prince recently, the fine artist, and he was an unsuccessful artist living in New York City for 20 years, and then something happened where someone bought some of his paintings for, I think, $50. And now, I don't know, 20 years after that, his uh refography, it's called, might sell it off for $60 million. And but for for 20 years, no one bought a one piece no one bought one piece of his art.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我最近采访了嗯，理查德·普林斯，一位优秀的艺术家，他在纽约市生活了20年，一直是一位不成功的艺术家，然后发生了一些事情，有人以我认为是50美元的价格买了他的一些画作。现在，我不知道，在那之后20年，他的嗯，所谓的“再摄影”（rephotography），可能会以6000万美元的价格售出。但在那20年里，没有人买过他的一件作品，没有人买过他的一件艺术品。</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. Yeah. And it's it it happens when it happens. He always stayed true to what he was doing and then all of a sudden people came around. Van Gogh, I don't think ever sold a painting during his lifetime, but he was true to himself. And now we go to a museum and we get to see Van Go. So the the market is almost like a secondary aspect where sometimes it catches on, sometimes it doesn't. And I would say maybe some of the greatest artists who who ever existed, we've never seen we've never seen their work because it's piece of that puzzle which is the ability to live in the world and promote their work and show their work. Like some there are some great musicians who are homeless. They don't have what it takes to be able to go on a 300 day tour. It's a grueling being a professional uh musician is a grueling life. So, you can be super talented, but if you don't have the work ethic side of it down, then that's not going to work either.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。是的。而且，它该发生的时候就会发生。他始终忠于自己所做的事情，然后突然之间人们就都来了。梵高，我想他在世时从未卖出过一幅画，但他忠于自己。现在我们去博物馆，就能看到梵高的作品。所以市场几乎像是一个次要方面，有时它会流行起来，有时则不会。我会说，也许一些有史以来最伟大的艺术家，我们从未见过他们的作品，因为那是拼图的一部分，即在世界上生活、推广他们的作品并展示他们的作品的能力。比如，有些伟大的音乐家是无家可归的。他们不具备进行为期300天巡演的能力。成为一名职业音乐家是一段艰苦的生活。所以，你可能非常有才华，但如果你没有那方面的职业道德，那也行不通。</p>
            <p class="english">It's both the the talent, the inspiration, the stars aligning, and the ability to want to break through the walls that you need to break through in these competitive fields. All of those things have to come together and and a lot of it's out of our control. you know, the the parts that are in our control is we can work hard, we can show up, we could do our best and be willing to do whatever it takes for it to work, but that still doesn't guarantee that it works.</p>
            <p class="chinese">这既包括天赋、灵感、时运，也包括在这些竞争激烈的领域中，想要突破那些你需要突破的壁垒的能力。所有这些因素都必须结合在一起，而且很多事情是我们无法控制的。你知道，我们能控制的部分是，我们可以努力工作，我们可以出现，我们可以尽力而为，并且愿意为之付出一切努力使其成功，但这仍然不能保证它会成功。</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How to Best Serve an Audience / 如何最好地服务观众</h2>
            <p class="english">Right? So, there's a thing in music uh tell me if this is true. There's a sort of cliche in music which is every uh artist's first album, first hit album is the result of, you know, 20 years of, you know, artistic creativity and, you know, evolution and original thinking and new ideas and new styles and, you know, kind of the, you know, the thing that makes them, you know, kind of break through, uh, you know, some some new thing. like that's album number one and then album number two is always about life on the road.</p>
            <p class="chinese">对吧？所以，音乐中有一件事，呃，告诉我这是否属实。音乐中有一种老生常谈的说法，那就是每个艺术家的第一张专辑，第一张热门专辑，都是，你知道，20年艺术创造力、进化、原创思维、新想法、新风格的结晶，你知道，那种让他们，你知道，取得突破的东西，呃，你知道，一些新的东西。比如那是第一张专辑，然后第二张专辑总是关于巡演生活。</p>
            <p class="english">It's often the case, right? Because all of a sudden to your point like that is their life. It's also possible that an artist has uh had a hard life and then found success and their life changes and now they live in luxury and they can't tap into that energy that that what they were struggling against. The struggle was their art and now they're not struggling anymore.</p>
            <p class="chinese">通常是这样，对吧？因为突然之间，就像你说的，那就是他们的生活。也可能一个艺术家经历了艰难的生活，然后取得了成功，他们的生活改变了，现在他们生活在奢华之中，他们无法再触及那种他们曾经与之抗争的能量。抗争是他们的艺术，现在他们不再抗争了。</p>
            <p class="english">Let's take everything that you guys have said on this on these topics as true. Let's just assume this is all correct which I think it is. Then the advice that gets applied, you know, and you hear this a lot in startup world. Uh the advice gets applied is, you know, follow your passion. You know, you know, you know, screw the doubters. The doubters are wrong. Um don't market test things. You know, don't worry about the audience. Don't worry about the market. Like just do the thing that you think you're on planet Earth to do.</p>
            <p class="chinese">让我们把你们在这些话题上所说的一切都视为真实的。让我们假设这一切都是正确的，我认为确实如此。那么，随之而来的建议，你知道，这在初创企业界经常听到。呃，随之而来的建议是，你知道，追随你的激情。你知道，你知道，你知道，去他妈的怀疑者。怀疑者是错的。嗯，不要进行市场测试。你知道，不要担心观众。不要担心市场。就像，只做你认为你生来就该做的事情。</p>
            <p class="english">Um, you could argue that that's good advice because it's it gets people down this path, you know, like Rick of of like what you do with artists, um, to kind of discovering authenticity. Um, you could also argue though there's like a degenerate version of that advice which basically is like just be narcissistic. Just be narcissistic, just be completely self-absorbed and, you know, just do things for yourself and, you know, just like completely disregard the entire concept of an audience. like it it like what what's the dividing line when when sort of advice that deres from these ideas is actually like good advice versus at what point is it just actually encouraging people to become insufferable um and to and and sort of to unplug from the things that they would need to do to actually find an audience.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，你可以说这是好建议，因为它能引导人们走上这条路，你知道，就像里克你和艺术家们所做的那样，嗯，去发现真实性。嗯，但你也可以说，这种建议有一个退化的版本，基本上就是：只管自恋。只管自恋，完全自我陶醉，你知道，只为自己做事，你知道，就像完全无视观众这个概念一样。比如，当源于这些想法的建议实际上是好建议时，与它在什么程度上实际上只是在鼓励人们变得令人难以忍受，嗯，并且，并且某种程度上脱离了他们为真正找到观众所需要做的事情，这两者之间的分界线是什么？</p>
            <p class="english">I believe that the audience comes last and the artist should be true to themselves and that ultimately is in service to the audience. The audience is best served when they get the real version of you. If you start watering down the real version of you to do what you want, right, it's a recipe for disaster.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我相信观众是最后考虑的，艺术家应该忠于自我，这最终也是为观众服务的。当观众得到真实的你时，他们才能得到最好的服务。如果你开始稀释真实的你，去做你想做的事情，对吧，那将是灾难的根源。</p>
            <p class="english">But that said, some of the like in movies like some of the best directors do extensive uh like uh they will do testing like you know they'll they'll make the movie, they will test it, they will take the audience feedback because you know because it just turns out they lo like when they see the audience react to what they've what they've made they realize things about it that causes them to improve it. Like is that a legit like I was gonna say so is that a legitimate like what's the line between that and and and and what what you're trying to get them to not do?</p>
            <p class="chinese">但话虽如此，有些像电影里的一些最好的导演会进行广泛的，呃，比如，他们会进行测试，比如你知道他们会制作电影，他们会测试它，他们会听取观众的反馈，因为你知道，因为事实证明他们，当他们看到观众对他们制作的东西的反应时，他们会意识到一些事情，从而促使他们改进它。比如，这是否合法，我想说，这是否合理，这与你试图让他们不要做的事情之间的界限是什么？</p>
            <p class="english">Well, sometimes you'll have a director show a movie to an audience and realize problems with it and work on them. And there are other times that they'll show a movie to an audience and the audience hates it and knows movies go on to be great hits. So it there is no hard and fast rule. It's like did they show it to the right audience? Not everything is for everybody. That's another part of it. It's like how do you get to the audience that's the right audience for the thing that you're making.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，有时你会看到导演给观众看一部电影，然后意识到其中的问题并加以改进。还有些时候，他们给观众看一部电影，观众讨厌它，但这些电影后来却大获成功。所以没有一成不变的规则。这就像，他们是给正确的观众看了吗？并非所有东西都适合所有人。这是另一方面。关键在于你如何接触到适合你所创作的东西的正确观众。</p>
            <p class="english">There's a famous story there was one one more thing. So there's a famous story from the making of Blazing Saddles and I don't know if it's true but if it's not it should be. Yeah. Um which is Mel Brooks made Blazing Saddles and uh he screened it for the executives I think at Warner Brothers. Uh and it was like the the nobody laughed. They sat there in stun silence. They were completely horrified and like they were just like this thing is a train wreck. like this is horrible. Um and then they did a a follow-up screening with the assistants and the secretaries and who just like were howling with laughter the entire way through. Um and so um yeah, no, you know, now the I guess maybe the the claim or the critique on this would be yes, if you're Mel Brooks and you've made Blazing Saddles, it's fine to have test screenings in which nobody laughs. Yeah. But like you know, your median filmmaker who does that is probably has probably actually really truly shed the bed.</p>
            <p class="chinese">还有一个著名的故事。关于《灼热的马鞍》（Blazing Saddles）的制作过程有一个著名的故事，我不知道是不是真的，但如果不是，也应该是。是的。嗯，那就是梅尔·布鲁克斯制作了《灼热的马鞍》，呃，我想他给华纳兄弟的高管们放映了这部电影。呃，结果是，没有人笑。他们目瞪口呆地坐在那里，鸦雀无声。他们完全被吓坏了，觉得这东西简直是一场灾难，太可怕了。嗯，然后他们又给助理和秘书们放映了一场，结果那些人从头到尾都笑得前仰后合。嗯，所以，嗯，是的，不，你知道，现在我想，也许对此的说法或批评是，是的，如果你是梅尔·布鲁克斯，并且你制作了《灼热的马鞍》，那么进行试映，即使没有人笑，也没关系。是的。但是，你知道，一般的电影制作人如果这样做，可能，可能真的，真的搞砸了。</p>
            <p class="english">But how do you know? Again, how do you know? How do you know it?</p>
            <p class="chinese">但你怎么知道呢？再说一次，你怎么知道？你怎么知道它？</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. So, so I've got I've got a I've got a a somewhat refined answer to your question, Mark. So, there is a there there was a band um that had a great name called Soul to Soul. And the reason it's a great name is because that's kind of um what music is, from my soul to your soul.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。所以，马克，我对你的问题有一个稍微完善一点的答案。曾经有一个乐队，嗯，名字很棒，叫做Soul to Soul。它之所以是个好名字，是因为这在某种程度上，嗯，就是音乐的本质，从我的灵魂到你的灵魂。</p>
            <p class="english">And so as an artist, if it doesn't come from your soul or as an entrepreneur, um it's never going to work. Now, there may be an alignment thing to getting it exactly to land. Um but if you compromise the original thing, then you're just a wreck. Um and actually in uh so in entrepreneur world like we saw this with data bricks where like they had a very clear vision of what they were going to be and the audience wanted it on premise. Um and they refused to do it because it was so contrary to their vision.</p>
            <p class="chinese">所以，作为一名艺术家，如果它不是发自你的灵魂，或者作为一名企业家，嗯，它永远不会成功。现在，可能需要一些调整才能让它完美落地。嗯，但如果你妥协了最初的东西，那你就会一败涂地。嗯，实际上，在，呃，在企业家世界，就像我们在Databricks身上看到的那样，他们对自己的未来有非常清晰的愿景，但观众希望它在本地部署。嗯，他们拒绝这样做，因为这与他们的愿景背道而驰。</p>
            <p class="english">Um but they still you know they still had to do a lot of work to understand the the customer needs over time but like the core core core idea they had was like it had to be in the cloud. Um, and I think that, you know, when you compromise the core thing in in kind of entrepreneurship at art, which is like this is the thing that I really really feel, um, then then it's always going to be bad. Like there's no way to make that good after the fact by listening to feedback.</p>
            <p class="chinese">嗯，但他们仍然，你知道，他们仍然需要做很多工作来理解客户随时间变化的需求，但他们最核心的想法是，它必须在云端。嗯，我认为，你知道，当你在艺术领域的创业中妥协了核心的东西，也就是那种你真正、真正感受到的东西，嗯，那么它总是会变糟。就像，事后通过听取反馈是无法让它变好的。</p>
            <p class="english">But Ben, the tension I find there, let's say I'm I'm going to channel being a my my dark founder days, you know, when I was you're in the middle of the idea maze. You've got a you've got something that you believe the world needs, but you read Mark's product market fit, you know, definition and you stare at it when in tears because it's it's not resonating, right? You've put you've put out what you think the world needs, but it's not resonating.</p>
            <p class="chinese">但是本，我发现其中的张力在于，假设我回到了我那段黑暗的创始人岁月，你知道，当我，当你身处创意迷宫之中。你有一个你相信世界需要的东西，但你读了马克关于产品市场契合度的定义，然后你含着泪盯着它，因为它没有引起共鸣，对吧？你已经推出了你认为世界需要的东西，但它没有引起共鸣。</p>
            <p class="english">I is the answer to reconcile what Rick is saying and what you're saying, which which is you you can't compromise what matters. And yet, you know, uh or reconcile what Mark was saying is you you've got to when you're building for a customer, you've you've got to change everything about it before you have product market fit until you find it. Is the answer that you just have to care really authentically about a type of person you want to serve and then exceed their expectations. And what's authentic and true is that you care deeply about some particular person in the world who you want to serve because your job is is to build a product or service or in the case of a musician to to serve humanity by by evoking a feeling or or or helping someone when when they listen to your hip-hop record to to lift them up and give them the the pep they need to go about their day. Is the answer that you have to be in service of somebody else to ultimately serve yourself?</p>
            <p class="chinese">我的答案是，要调和里克所说的和你所说的，那就是你不能在重要的事情上妥协。然而，你知道，呃，或者调和马克所说的，当你在为客户构建产品时，你必须在找到产品市场契合度之前改变关于它的一切。答案是不是你只需要真正地、真诚地关心你想服务的那类人，然后超越他们的期望？而真实和真诚的是，你深深地关心世界上某个你想服务特定的人，因为你的工作是构建产品或服务，或者对于音乐家来说，是通过唤起一种感觉，或者在别人听你的嘻哈唱片时帮助他们，提升他们，给他们一天所需的活力。答案是不是你必须服务于他人，才能最终服务于自己？</p>
            <p class="english">I I can say it's it's so simple that you're serving people like you. You're the audience. You're making your favorite thing. You're in love with it. And then other people who like the things you like will like it. Other than that is some sort of mind readading. It's some sort of like fiction. You can't know what anyone else is going to think or like or do. If you taste some food and you love it, you're excited. You guys got to taste this. It's so good and you'll either like it or not. But there's no better judge. I I can't I can't taste food and say this tastes terrible to me, but I think you're really going to love it. It's impo It's impossible way to live, right?</p>
            <p class="chinese">我可以说，这很简单，你是在为你这样的人服务。你就是观众。你在做你最喜欢的事情。你热爱它。然后其他喜欢你所喜欢的东西的人也会喜欢它。除此之外，都是某种程度的读心术。是某种程度的虚构。你无法知道别人会怎么想、喜欢什么或做什么。如果你尝到某种食物并且喜欢它，你会很兴奋。你们一定要尝尝这个。它太好吃了，你们要么喜欢，要么不喜欢。但没有比这更好的评判标准了。我不能尝了食物说这对我来说太难吃了，但我认为你一定会非常喜欢它。这不可能，这是一种不可能的生活方式，对吧？</p>
            <p class="english">You know, it's funny. We don't really have a word for we don't really have a positive word for narcissism. Yeah. Or solopypsism is the other, you know, solop self-absorption. like self-absorption, self-nowledge, no know they know one self, no oneself, right? Yeah. Which is a very deep thing. It's an extremely deep concept that takes you a lifetime to do sometimes, you know. Yeah. Um but but you're right, it is generally frowned upon by society.</p>
            <p class="chinese">你知道，这很有趣。我们并没有一个词来形容，我们并没有一个积极的词来形容自恋。是的。或者唯我论是另一个，你知道，唯我独尊，自我沉溺。就像自我沉溺，自我认知，不，认识自我，认识自己，对吧？是的。这是一个非常深刻的事情。这是一个极其深刻的概念，有时需要你用一生去实践，你知道。是的。嗯，但是，你是对的，这通常不为社会所接受。</p>
            <p class="english">Ben, it seems like that's the future of of education. If if expertise matters less and less, what matters more and more is taste and being in touch with yourself and and this kind of self-nowledge. And so h how do we think about that Rick in terms of sort of the future of education in a world where where you know the skills that you have i.e. sort of the lack of skills in certain areas but but a high regard of taste is is just more important.</p>
            <p class="chinese">本，这似乎是教育的未来。如果专业知识越来越不重要，那么品味、与自己保持联系以及这种自我认知就越来越重要。那么，里克，在一个你所拥有的技能，即在某些领域缺乏技能，但高度重视品味的世界里，我们如何看待教育的未来呢？</p>
            <p class="english">Yeah. It seems like taste and curiosity and um open-mindedness is where it's at and and that's what um I don't know. I have uh I don't I don't remember ever learning anything in school that was helpful to me at any point in my life.</p>
            <p class="chinese">是的。看来品味、好奇心和嗯，开放的心态才是关键，而那正是我，我不知道。我，嗯，我不记得在学校里学到过任何在我生命中任何时候对我有帮助的东西。</p>

            <h2>Outro: Vibe With Yourself / 结语：与自我共振</h2>
            <p class="english">My takeaway is basically that you're saying we've got to vibe with ourselves when using these tools and watching and reading the way of code is basically a window into watching how you Rick vibed with yourself in the creation of this. It's a again a 30,000-y old manual on how to vibe with yourself. That's what it is.</p>
            <p class="chinese">我的理解基本上是，你在说我们在使用这些工具时必须与自己产生共鸣，而观看和阅读《编程之道》基本上是一个窗口，让我们看到你，里克，在创作这个作品时是如何与自己产生共鸣的。这又是一本有三万年历史的关于如何与自己产生共鸣的手册。就是这样。</p>
