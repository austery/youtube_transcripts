                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">My guest today is Catherine Rampell. She's an economics columnist at the Washington Post, an anchor at MSNBC, and she's been covering this closely, and I've asked her to come on the show today to help talk through all the different risks this bill brings and what it'll really mean for people's lives. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我今天的嘉宾是凯瑟琳·兰佩尔。她是《华盛顿邮报》的经济专栏作家，MSNBC 的主播，她一直密切关注此事，我今天请她来节目，帮助我们梳理这项法案带来的所有不同风险，以及它对人们的生活真正意味着什么。我的邮箱一如既往：ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com。</p>
                <p class="english-text">Catherine, welcome to the show.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">凯瑟琳，欢迎来到节目。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Great to join you.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">很高兴加入你们。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">So this big beautiful bill, big beautiful budget. It is really quite big. There's a lot in it. If you could only tell people about three or four of its parts, what would they be?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">那么，这个“宏伟美丽的法案”，宏伟美丽的预算。它确实相当庞大，内容很多。如果你只能告诉人们其中三四个部分，那会是什么？</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">I think I would say it is a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich, from the young to the old, and from the future to the past.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我想我会说，这是财富从穷人向富人、从年轻人向老年人、从未来向过去的转移。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Walk me through that.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">详细解释一下。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">So it has a lot of big bundles of parts in it which normally we would have more time to digest piecemeal, but those include big tax cuts which are generally quite regressive. They help higher-income people more. It also includes big cuts to the safety net, particularly Medicaid and SNAP, otherwise known as food stamps. And it includes basically eliminating a bunch of climate-related tax credits which are investments in the future, as well as cutting programs that disproportionately help children, which I would also say robs our future, and will still cost a lot of money, which leaves the bill due to future generations of taxpayers.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">所以它包含了很多大的组成部分，通常我们会有更多时间逐一消化，但这些包括大规模减税，这些减税通常是相当累退的，它们更多地帮助高收入人群。它还包括大幅削减社会保障网络，特别是医疗补助计划（Medicaid）和补充营养援助计划（SNAP），也就是食品券。它还包括基本取消一系列与气候相关的税收抵免，这些是对未来的投资，以及削减那些不成比例地帮助儿童的项目，我也会说这剥夺了我们的未来，并且仍将花费大量资金，这将使未来的纳税人承担这笔账单。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">And how big is that bill?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">那笔账单有多大？</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Depends on how you calculate it. There are a bunch of competing estimates out there, but over 10 years, you know, it's somewhere around $4 trillion. And before the negotiations are done, it may well be more than that because there are a bunch of Republicans who want even more tax cuts.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">这取决于你如何计算。目前有许多相互矛盾的估计，但在 10 年内，大约是 4 万亿美元左右。而且在谈判完成之前，这个数字很可能还会更高，因为有很多共和党人想要更多的减税。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">You and I are both battle-scarred veterans of the 2010 budget fights.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">你我都是 2010 年预算之争中身经百战的老兵了。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Oh yes. Oh yes.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">哦是的，哦是的。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">And I think those fights, when we were constantly being told by Republicans that we were about to become Greece and needed immediate austerity, and then in fact interest rates were completely fine for years and years, soured a lot of people on warnings about the debt. But we're in a pretty different interest rate environment now. So interest rates are a lot higher.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我认为那些争斗——当时共和党人不断告诉我们，我们即将变成希腊，需要立即实行紧缩政策，而事实上利率在很多年里都完全没问题——让很多人对债务警告感到厌倦。但我们现在处于一个相当不同的利率环境中，利率要高得多。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Yep. And the payments have gotten pretty serious. So interest payments are currently the second highest expenditure in the federal budget. It's more than our entire national defense spend. Adding a bunch more debt on top of that seems a little dangerous. How do you think about the debt burden we're facing down here?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。而且利息支付已经变得相当严重。目前，利息支付是联邦预算中第二高的支出，超过了我们全部的国防开支。在此基础上再增加一大笔债务似乎有点危险。你如何看待我们目前面临的债务负担？</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">What's that expression? Something that can't go on forever won't. I think that's kind of where we are, in that we cannot continue to sustain this level of deficit spending without at some point, you would think, bond investors revolting and needing to, or our political leaders needing to either cut spending or raise taxes or both. But when that actually happens, I have no idea. You know, it might be, depending on where Trump is headed to, what Trump is doing, other things to call into question the safety or risk-free nature of the dollar and US debt.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">那句话怎么说来着？无法永远持续下去的事情终将停止。我想我们现在就处于这种境地，我们无法继续维持这种水平的赤字支出，而不至于在某个时候，你会认为，债券投资者会反抗，或者我们的政治领导人需要削减开支或提高税收，或者两者兼而有之。但那究竟何时会发生，我毫不知情。你知道，这可能取决于特朗普的走向，特朗普正在做的事情，以及其他可能质疑美元和美国债务的安全性或无风险性的因素。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Well, this is aside, this is what worries me. So, I'm used to doing budget coverage and you tend to kind of sit in the confines of the budget. You're worried about this provision, that provision, but there's this interaction effect between what Trump is doing elsewhere, the tariffs, the trade war with China. We've seen bond markets shake recently under various fears, and then piling on a huge amount of new debt in this budget, if it passes, and we have this world where we have much higher interest rates. I think the Trump administration would like to see interest rates come down.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，这暂且不谈，这才是让我担心的。我习惯了报道预算，你往往会局限于预算的范畴内，担心这个条款，那个条款。但特朗普在其他方面所做的事情，比如关税、与中国的贸易战，与此存在着互动效应。我们最近看到债券市场在各种担忧下出现动荡，然后如果这项预算通过，又会增加巨额新债，而我们所处的世界利率又高得多。我认为特朗普政府希望看到利率下降。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Oh, Trump has made that more than clear.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">哦，特朗普已经把这一点说得再清楚不过了。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">More than clear. But passing a budget like this makes it a lot harder for the Fed to bring down interest rates.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">再清楚不过了。但通过这样的预算，会使美联储降低利率变得更加困难。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Yes. Well, a lot of things that the Trump administration is doing will make it harder to reduce interest rates. One of which is adding a lot more debt piled onto the existing debt that we already have. Some of it has to do with the fact that tariffs are likely to increase prices. All of these things are kind of coming together to make it more likely that rates either go up or at least don't come down as much as certainly anyone looking for a house would like them to be.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。嗯，特朗普政府正在做的很多事情都会让降低利率变得更加困难。其中之一就是在我们已有的债务基础上再增加更多债务。部分原因在于关税可能会导致物价上涨。所有这些因素共同作用，使得利率要么上升，要么至少不会像那些想买房的人所期望的那样下降那么多。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">I know this all gets wonky to try to plug the weird and quite, I think, dangerous budget into the other parts of the Trump administration's economic theory, but I want to try to do it for a minute because we've just spent months covering the tariffs and the theory behind the tariffs. And on some level, the theory behind the tariffs is this: that trade deficits are bad and this world where what's happening is that the rest of the world keeps giving us money, and we keep taking in all of their investment, and that has effects on the dollar and effects on our manufacturing. And the Trump administration wants that, on some level, to stop. They believe America's been ripped off by selling so many financial products in order to buy goods.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我知道试图将这个古怪且我认为相当危险的预算与其他特朗普政府经济理论的部分联系起来会显得很复杂，但我想尝试一下，因为我们刚刚花了几个月的时间报道关税及其背后的理论。在某种程度上，关税背后的理论是这样的：贸易逆差是不好的，而我们所处的世界是，世界其他国家不断给我们钱，我们不断吸纳他们所有的投资，这对美元和我们的制造业都产生了影响。特朗普政府在某种程度上希望停止这种情况。他们认为美国因为出售了如此多的金融产品来购买商品而吃了亏。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Yeah, that doesn't make any sense though. Like, I agree. That's one of the problems with this administration. It doesn't make any sense. And I think Scott Bessent is smart enough to know that it has been to our advantage that other countries or private individuals around the world want our treasuries because it has enabled us to continue borrowing and borrowing and borrowing and not have to make the politically difficult decisions to either raise taxes or cut benefits. So I don't... It sounds like you think that the administration wants people to stop buying our debt. Is that what... is that your theory of the case?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的，但这说不通。比如，我同意。这是本届政府的问题之一，它毫无道理。而且我认为斯科特·贝森特足够聪明，他知道其他国家或世界各地的私人个体想要购买我们的国债对我们是有利的，因为它使我们能够持续借贷，而不必做出提高税收或削减福利等政治上困难的决定。所以我不……听起来你认为政府希望人们停止购买我们的债务。是这样吗……这是你对这件事的看法吗？</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">I think that they believe that this world in which our financial products are so unbelievably attractive and we are buying so much from them, sold and giving them our money, and they take our debt, is a bad world. And they want to shift the balance of trade and inflows and outflows, and that's what the tariffs are largely about. And that they're doing this at this moment when they're going to pile on a bunch of debt. I think what's happening here is that Trump decided he likes tariffs and everybody around him scrambles to reverse engineer a justification for it.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我认为他们相信，我们金融产品如此具有吸引力，我们大量购买他们的产品，卖给他们东西，给他们钱，他们又购买我们的债务，这样一个世界是不好的。他们想改变贸易平衡以及资金的流入和流出，这在很大程度上就是关税的目的。而他们现在正是在要堆积大量债务的时刻做这件事。我认为这里发生的情况是，特朗普决定他喜欢关税，然后他周围的每个人都争先恐后地为之寻找理由。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">I don't disagree with that. I don't think that there's any strategy, like anybody is thinking, "Yes, we need to have more tariffs in order to have more manufacturing in order to have the rest of the world not buying our debt," because everything Trump wants to do will increase the debt. So I am not arguing that's not a contradiction. What I'm saying is you're doing both of these things. And they are putting on a bunch of tariffs. Yes. And they are making us a less trustworthy place to invest. And then on the other hand, they're going to radically increase our debt and the need to have the world keep buying it. And these two things together, making America a both less welcoming place for that kind of endless purchasing of our debt and making America a less trustworthy place to purchase debt and making America a place that needs to sell ever more debt seems like a recipe for things to go very badly wrong.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我对此并无异议。我不认为这其中有什么策略，比如有人在想：“是的，我们需要增加关税以促进制造业发展，从而让世界其他国家不再购买我们的债务”，因为特朗普想做的一切都会增加债务。所以我并不是说这不是矛盾的。我想说的是你们同时在做这两件事。他们确实在征收大量关税。是的。他们正在让我们成为一个不那么值得投资的地方。而另一方面，他们又将大幅增加我们的债务，以及让世界继续购买我们债务的需求。这两件事结合起来——让美国对于那种无休止购买我们债务的行为变得不那么友好，让美国成为一个不那么值得购买债务的地方，并让美国成为一个需要出售越来越多债务的地方——这似乎是导致事情严重出错的根源。</p>

                <p class="chinese-text">当然。在未来某个未知的时刻。是的，我百分之百同意这一点。这就是我所有这些论述的最终指向。</p>

                <p class="english-text">Okay. I 100% agree with all of that. And but I don't think that any of this is deliberate. You know, I think Trump is convinced that the bill won't cost anything. You know, people like Scott Bessent have told him it's going to supercharge growth and we'll grow our way out of debt and then we don't have to worry about whether there's appetite out there to buy more treasuries.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">好的。我百分之百同意所有这些。但我认为这一切都不是故意的。你知道，我认为特朗普坚信这项法案不会花费任何东西。像斯科特·贝森特这样的人告诉他，这将极大地刺激增长，我们将通过增长摆脱债务，然后我们就不必担心外界是否有购买更多国债的意愿了。</p>

                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">I think that it will stimulate demand somewhat in the near term. If people's taxes go down, they have more money to spend on other things. We saw that last time. So, you know, there'll be some supply-side effects, some demand-side effects, but not enough to overcome all of the other reasons why this is slowing the economy. So, like I was talking with this guy who is the CEO of a Christmas tree company, Balsam Hill. They sell artificial Christmas trees from China. And I was asking like, "So Trump says he's going to help you in the long run by cutting your taxes." And he said, "We ran the numbers and if they cut their taxes on their profits by half, that would offset a, you know, a 2% increase in tariffs." So it's just like the numbers don't add up, particularly for industries that are really exposed to the tariffs. But in general, like for the macroeconomy, no, these things are not going to fully pay for themselves, even if there is a tiny grain of truth to the idea that they could stimulate the economy, at least in the near term.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我认为短期内它会在一定程度上刺激需求。如果人们的税收下降，他们就有更多的钱花在其他事情上。我们上次就看到了这一点。所以，你知道，会有一些供给侧效应，一些需求侧效应，但不足以克服所有其他导致经济放缓的原因。比如，我和一家圣诞树公司 Balsam Hill 的 CEO 聊过。他们销售从中国进口的人造圣诞树。我问他：“特朗普说他会通过减税在长期内帮助你们。”他说：“我们计算过了，如果他们将利润税减半，那也就能抵消，你知道，2% 的关税增长。”所以，这就像数字对不上，特别是对于那些真正受到关税影响的行业。但总的来说，对于宏观经济而言，不，这些措施是无法完全自我买单的，即使它们可能在短期内刺激经济的说法有一点点道理。</p>

                <p class="english-text">Yeah. So there are basically three main ratings agencies and for a very, very long time the US debt was rated by all of these ratings agencies as pristine, risk-free, the, you know, the gold stars all around, AAA is what they called it. And then over the last 10 to 15 years, ratings agencies started knocking us down a peg and saying maybe they're not as good for their word as they seem to be. Including because there was a debt ceiling debacle where it looked like we might default on our debt, etc. More recently, the last holdout, Moody's, which I think had not downgraded us in over a hundred years, or we've had a perfect rating from them for over a hundred years. Moody's basically said, "Uh, yeah, we don't think these guys are quite as 100% good for their money as we once thought because the US deficits have already been on track to be growing and growing and growing. And now with the likely passage of this additional big beautiful bill, that problem is only going to get worse." So it doesn't, you know, it doesn't really mean anything per se, like it's more symbolic. It is more like yet another scolding from the financial markets in a way that lawmakers are acting irresponsibly.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。基本上有三家主要的评级机构，在很长很长一段时间里，美国债务都被所有这些评级机构评为原始的、无风险的，你知道，到处都是金星，他们称之为 AAA 级。然后在过去的 10 到 15 年里，评级机构开始降低我们的评级，说也许他们不像看起来那么信守承诺。其中包括因为曾发生过债务上限的崩溃，当时看起来我们可能会拖欠债务等等。最近，最后一个坚持者，穆迪——我认为他们一百多年来都没有下调过我们的评级，或者说我们一百多年来都从他们那里获得完美评级。穆迪基本上说：“嗯，是的，我们认为这些人不像我们曾经认为的那样百分之百值得信赖，因为美国的赤字已经在不断增长。而现在，随着这个额外的‘宏伟美丽的法案’可能通过，这个问题只会变得更糟。”所以，你知道，这本身并没有什么实际意义，更像是一种象征。这更像是金融市场对立法者不负责任行为的又一次斥责。</p>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">So, overall, most Americans will get a tax cut. I think a lot of the talking points are relative to, again, relative to what they would have had if no bill had passed because a lot of the tax code is expiring and people's taxes would have otherwise gone up. So, when you hear talking points like "these are only tax cuts for billionaires or corporations or whatever," that's not quite true. Like I think, I looked this up before we met, but basically 94% of Americans will get some tax cut relative to what would have happened if Congress does nothing. But the very biggest benefits definitely go to higher income classes. Like two-thirds, this is from the Tax Policy Center, two-thirds of the plan's tax cuts by dollar value go to those in the top quintile. People in the top 1% would get about a quarter of the tax cuts. So that's people making over a million dollars. Basically, they get about a quarter of the benefits. And then if you look at the overall bill, it's not only that the rich benefit more, it's that the poor come out behind because to the extent that any of this is paid for at all, it's largely paid for by taking other benefits away from low-income people.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">所以，总的来说，大多数美国人都会获得减税。我认为很多论点都是相对的，再次强调，是相对于如果没有任何法案通过他们本会拥有的情况而言，因为很多税法即将到期，人们的税收本会上升。所以，当你听到诸如“这只是针对亿万富翁或公司等的减税”之类的论点时，那并不完全正确。比如我想，在我们见面之前我查过这个，但基本上 94% 的美国人会获得一些减税，相对于如果国会什么都不做会发生的情况。但最大的受益者绝对是高收入阶层。比如三分之二，这是来自税收政策中心的数据，按美元价值计算，该计划减税额的三分之二流向了收入最高的五分之一人群。收入最高的 1% 的人将获得大约四分之一的减税额。也就是年收入超过一百万美元的人。基本上，他们获得了大约四分之一的利益。然后如果你看整个法案，不仅仅是富人受益更多，穷人反而落后了，因为在某种程度上，所有这些费用的支付，很大程度上是通过剥夺低收入人群的其他福利来实现的。</p>

                <p class="english-text">Medicaid and food stamps are the biggies here. Medicaid currently enrolls something like one in five Americans. It's a huge program. It's a popular program. And Republicans have argued that their changes are only about kicking off, you know, the freeloaders and apocryphal welfare queens and we'll make sure that everyone who is deserving of this public health insurance program continues to receive it. But if you actually look at the provisions themselves, that seems very unlikely.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">医疗补助计划（Medicaid）和食品券是这里的大头。医疗补助计划目前覆盖了大约五分之一的美国人。这是一个庞大的项目，也是一个受欢迎的项目。共和党人辩称，他们的改革只是为了剔除那些占便宜的人和虚构的“福利女王”，并确保每个有资格享受这项公共健康保险计划的人都能继续获得。但如果你仔细研究这些条款本身，这似乎非常不可能。</p>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">I want to stay on the Medicaid side of this for a minute. One of the big ways they're trying to save money in Medicaid without saying what they're doing is cutting it is what's called work requirements. And the theory of work requirements is we make you prove that if you're an able-bodied person that you have worked more than 80 hours or you are looking for work in some kind of intense way. And if you can't prove that, you lose your Medicaid because, you know, if you're going to get the benefit of Medicaid, you should show the responsibility of either working or looking for work. The problem is, and my partner Annie Lowrey has talked about this as the time tax and written about this kind of administrative complexity a lot, we make it so hard to do and to prove that huge numbers of people lose coverage through being unable to complete the paperwork. And so you're weaponizing time and bureaucratic complexity to deny people a benefit they are supposed to have. So, how much of the Medicaid cut is built around that?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我想在医疗补助计划这方面停留一会儿。他们在医疗补助计划中试图省钱，却又不直说是在削减开支的一个主要方式，就是所谓的“工作要求”。工作要求的理论是，我们让你证明，如果你是一个身体健全的人，你已经工作了超过 80 个小时，或者你正在以某种积极的方式寻找工作。如果你无法证明这一点，你就会失去医疗补助，因为，你知道，如果你想获得医疗补助的福利，你就应该表现出工作或寻找工作的责任。问题在于，我的搭档安妮·洛瑞曾将其称为“时间税”，并大量撰文论述这种行政复杂性，我们把这件事弄得如此难以完成和证明，以至于大量的人因为无法完成文书工作而失去保险。所以你们这是在将时间和官僚复杂性武器化，以剥夺人们本应享有的福利。那么，医疗补助计划的削减有多少是围绕这一点进行的？</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">So, a lot of it, and I actually did a lot of on-the-ground reporting about a pilot version of this back in 2018, 2019 in Arkansas where the Trump administration allowed Arkansas to impose work requirements. And I'll say a few things. So, the first thing is like this is a very popular actually provision. Something like 62% of Americans like the idea of Medicaid work requirements, including about half of Democrats. So, it's because it sounds reasonable. Why shouldn't people have to show that they are productive members of society in order to receive these government benefits? But it's not really clear like what problem it's trying to solve in that almost two-thirds of people who are on Medicaid are working. They're working either part-time or full-time. And the remainder who are not working have something that is generally considered like an allowable excuse, meaning that they're a full-time caregiver, they're enrolled in school, they have a disability, etc. It's only a very tiny slice of people who don't have one of these exclusions, one of these exemptions that's spelled out. So in Arkansas, most of the people, something like 18,000 people lost their Medicaid within the span of a few months. Most of those people were kicked off of Medicaid not because they were shown to have not been working or have one of these other allowable exemptions, but for administrative reasons. Basically, they didn't fill out the paperwork or they didn't fill it out sufficiently. There was one guy that I profiled, Adrian McGonagall, who actually was working at a chicken plant, and he got confused about how to report his hours. It was like not mobile friendly. The website literally shut down after, I think, 9:00 every day. I don't know, the hamsters had to go to bed or something. And he didn't have access to a computer. He only had his phone. And he thought he did it once and that was sufficient. Anyway, he lost his health coverage. He had severe COPD because he was not able to get his medications and to treat this chronic illness. He ended up getting very sick, lost his job at the chicken plant. And so this policy that was sold as encouraging people to get jobs actually cost him his. He unfortunately passed away quite recently as I learned. I got in touch with his former legal aid attorney and who had said that, ultimately Adrian had been one of the plaintiffs in the case to challenge this law and did get it overturned and he was able to get his Medicaid back, but he kind of went into this downward financial and health spiral as a result of all of this. So, these things have consequences. And you know, there are long-term harms that are created by what seems like, you know, reasonable paperwork to some people, but the reality is that this is a backdoor way of basically purging people from their health insurance. Again, to take it back to the Congressional Budget Office, that is their assumption as well.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">所以，很大一部分是这样，我实际上在 2018 年、2019 年在阿肯色州做过很多关于此事的试点版本的实地报道，当时特朗普政府允许阿肯色州实施工作要求。我会说几点。首先，这实际上是一个非常受欢迎的条款。大约 62% 的美国人喜欢医疗补助工作要求的想法，其中包括大约一半的民主党人。所以，这是因为它听起来很合理。为什么人们不应该为了获得这些政府福利而证明自己是社会的生产力成员呢？但它究竟试图解决什么问题并不清楚，因为将近三分之二的医疗补助受益人都在工作，他们要么是兼职要么是全职。而其余没有工作的人，通常都有一些被认为是可接受的理由，比如他们是全职照顾者，正在上学，有残疾等等。只有极少数人没有这些明确规定的排除或豁免情况。所以在阿肯色州，大多数人，大约 18000 人在几个月内失去了医疗补助。这些人中的大多数被取消医疗补助，并非因为他们被证明没有工作或没有其他可接受的豁免，而是因为行政原因。基本上，他们没有填写文书，或者没有充分填写。我曾报道过一个人，阿德里安·麦戈纳格尔，他实际上在一家鸡肉加工厂工作，但他搞不清如何报告工时。网站对移动设备不友好，而且每天晚上 9 点之后（我想是这样）网站就关闭了，我不知道，也许是仓鼠该睡觉了什么的。他没有电脑，只有手机。他以为做过一次就够了。总之，他失去了健康保险。他患有严重的慢性阻塞性肺病，因为他无法获得药物来治疗这种慢性病。他最终病得很重，失去了鸡肉加工厂的工作。所以这个被宣传为鼓励人们就业的政策，实际上让他失去了工作。不幸的是，我最近得知他去世了。我联系了他以前的法律援助律师，律师说，阿德里安最终是挑战这项法律的案件的原告之一，并且确实推翻了这项法律，他得以重新获得医疗补助，但由于这一切，他陷入了财务和健康的恶性循环。所以，这些事情是有后果的。你知道，那些在一些人看来是合理文书工作的事情，会造成长期的伤害，但现实是，这是一种变相剥夺人们健康保险的方式。再次回到国会预算办公室，这也是他们的假设。</p>

That is what their assumption is. This policy that again is supposed to be about making sure only the deserving people get jobs and encouraging more people to pick themselves up by their own bootstraps will actually have no effect on how many people have jobs.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">国会预算办公室表示，是的，这将节省大量资金，许多人将失去健康保险。就业方面不会有任何变化。这是他们的假设。这项再次声称旨在确保只有应得之人获得工作并鼓励更多人自力更生的政策，实际上对就业人数没有任何影响。</p>

                <p class="english-text">Yes. And I just think this is ugly. If you want to argue that people shouldn't have healthcare, fine. If you want to argue people should have jobs, we could have all kinds of labor market policies that help people get jobs. None of which are in this bill. But for the administration to then add a huge layer of bureaucratic complexity, how good will the other languages of this paperwork be? How quick will the response times in these agencies? Will the website shut down after 9:00 p.m.? It just, it really reveals something. Both an unwillingness, I mean Trump has promised not to cut Medicaid, an unwillingness to stand up for what they're actually doing and then an effort to weaponize the very bureaucratic inefficiency that they otherwise pretend to condemn and root out against the weakest and most powerless segment of society. People who do not make enough money to get health insurance.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。我只是觉得这很丑陋。如果你想争辩说人们不应该拥有医疗保健，那好吧。如果你想争辩说人们应该有工作，我们可以制定各种劳动力市场政策来帮助人们找到工作。这些在这项法案中都没有。但是，政府随后又增加了一层巨大的官僚复杂性，这份文书的其他语言版本会有多好？这些机构的响应时间会有多快？网站会在晚上 9 点后关闭吗？这确实揭示了一些东西。既不愿意——我的意思是特朗普承诺不削减医疗补助计划——不愿意为他们实际在做的事情辩护，然后又试图将他们假装谴责和根除的官僚低效武器化，用来对付社会中最弱势、最无助的群体——那些收入不足以获得健康保险的人。</p>

                <p class="english-text">Yeah. There's a bunch of other red tape that they add. They require that people on Medicaid have to re-prove eligibility more frequently, which again, if the process were completely seamless, who cares? But it's not. Every time people have to re-prove eligibility, even if nothing has changed in their situation, there's a chance the paperwork gets lost. People have to find the time to go to the office, you know, to deliver the forms in person or they have to navigate this clunky website or whatever. It's just a matter of, you know, like hacking through all of this red tape, American Ninja style, you know, that's sort of how I picture it. It's an obstacle course essentially that they've set up for people to make it harder for them to prove that they are entitled to the benefits that they are legally entitled to.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。他们还增加了很多其他的繁文缛节。他们要求医疗补助计划的受益人更频繁地重新证明资格，再说一次，如果这个过程完全无缝衔接，谁会在乎呢？但事实并非如此。每次人们必须重新证明资格时，即使他们的情况没有任何变化，文书也有可能丢失。人们必须抽出时间去办公室，你知道，亲自递交表格，或者他们必须浏览这个笨拙的网站等等。这就像，你知道，必须像美国忍者勇士一样闯过所有这些繁文缛节，我大概是这样想象的。这基本上是他们为人们设置的一个障碍赛，让他们更难证明自己有权获得他们合法应得的福利。</p>

                <p class="english-text">Mhm. And there's also the... A lot of this bill is about extending tax cuts from the past.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯。还有……这项法案的很多内容是关于延长过去的减税政策。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Yes. But right now, there are these subsidies for the Affordable Care Act. They're passed under the Biden administration which have made the premiums in the Affordable Care Act much cheaper. They've led to a pretty big increase in the number of people enrolled. And one of the pay-fors in the bill is to allow those to expire. Do you mind talking a bit about how that'll work?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。但现在，有这些针对《平价医疗法案》的补贴。它们是在拜登政府时期通过的，使得《平价医疗法案》的保费便宜了很多，并导致参保人数大幅增加。而这项法案中的一个“买单”方式就是让这些补贴到期。你介意谈谈这将如何运作吗？</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Uh yes. So understandably there's been a lot of focus on Medicaid. There are other provisions either in the bill or part of sort of the broader Republican agenda that will also end up with people losing their health insurance. There are these expanded subsidies essentially for people to buy insurance on the individual marketplace that have partly been responsible for the fact that the uninsured rate in America I think was at its lowest level on record last year. It's partly because of Medicaid expansion. It's partly because of this and it's like technical and wonky and people don't really pay attention to it. But those expanded subsidies were passed by Democrats and were set, are set to expire at the end of this year. Republicans could choose to extend those just as they are extending a lot of other things on the tax side, pretending that extension costs no money. Correct. Um but they have chosen not to. So when you see these scarier figures for how many people are going to newly become uninsured from the CBO, you know, over 13 million people, that is inclusive of Medicaid changes to the Affordable Care Act and some other regulatory stuff that basically Congress is codifying.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，是的。可以理解，人们一直非常关注医疗补助计划。法案中还有其他条款，或者说是更广泛的共和党议程的一部分，这些也会导致人们失去健康保险。这些扩大的补贴基本上是为人们在个人市场上购买保险提供的，它们部分促成了去年美国未参保率达到历史最低水平的事实。这部分归功于医疗补助计划的扩大，部分归功于此，这有点技术性和复杂性，人们不太关注。但这些扩大的补贴是由民主党通过的，并原定于今年年底到期。共和党人本可以选择延长这些补贴，就像他们在税收方面延长很多其他东西一样，假装延长不花钱。正确。但他们选择了不这样做。所以当你看到国会预算办公室（CBO）给出的那些更吓人的数字，关于有多少人将新近失去保险——超过 1300 万人——这包括了医疗补助计划对《平价医疗法案》的修改，以及国会基本上正在编纂的一些其他监管内容。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">So I just want to put a very fine point on this. According to our best read of what the bill is going to do, we are going to drive 13 million people off health insurance.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">所以我想非常明确地指出这一点。根据我们对该法案将产生何种影响的最佳解读，我们将导致 1300 万人失去健康保险。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Yes. We are going to end $300 billion of spending that gives food to hungry people. And that is going to go to pay for, depending on how you calculate it, roughly a quarter of tax cuts goes to the top 1%. Like that's the fundamental math of this bill.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。我们将终止 3000 亿美元用于为饥饿人群提供食物的支出。而这笔钱将用于支付——取决于你如何计算——大约四分之一的减税额流向了收入最高的 1% 人群。这基本上就是这项法案的核心算法。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Yes, that is the fundamental math of this bill. And this is part of the reason why I and others have characterized it as a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich because it is forcing low-income people who would otherwise have access to these safety net benefits that have been around and been popular for many decades among Republicans, as Senator Josh Hawley has been saying.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的，这就是这项法案的核心算法。这也是我和其他人将其描述为大规模财富从穷人向富人转移的部分原因，因为它迫使那些本可以获得这些已经存在数十年并且在共和党人中也很受欢迎的社会保障网络福利的低收入人群失去这些福利，正如参议员乔什·霍利所说的那样。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Well, yeah. I mean, just as an aside, there are Republicans in the House who very narrowly won their elections last year by fewer votes than the number of people who are on Medicaid in their districts. So, yeah, politically, besides like the human cost of all of this, politically it seems pretty dumb to me because while there is maybe a stereotype of who is the typical food stamp recipient or the typical Medicaid recipient, a stereotype that's, you know, racialized, among other things, people from all walks of life go through periods where they need this assistance. Many of them are Republicans. Many of them live in districts that are currently represented by Republicans. And at some point, people are going to notice when they can't put food on the table or they can't get the inhaler for their kid.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，是的。我的意思是，顺便说一句，众议院中有一些共和党人去年以非常微弱的优势赢得了选举，他们的胜选票数甚至少于他们选区内享受医疗补助计划的人数。所以，是的，从政治上讲，除了所有这一切的人道代价之外，这在我看来也相当愚蠢，因为尽管对于典型的食品券领取者或典型的医疗补助计划领取者可能存在刻板印象——一种被种族化等等的刻板印象——但各行各业的人都会经历需要这种援助的时期。他们中的许多人是共和党人。他们中的许多人生活在目前由共和党人代表的选区。到某个时候，当人们无法把食物摆上餐桌，或者无法为孩子买到吸入器时，他们会注意到的。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">It used to be the case in American politics that Democrats won voters who made less than $50,000 by a lot and Republicans won voters who made more than $100,000 by a lot. And so we used to have these fights over the safety net, but they somewhat aligned with the political coalitions. Republicans wanted to cut benefits like this, but mostly those were not their voters. In 2024, Donald Trump won voters making less than $50,000. Wasn't a huge victory among them, but he won them. Donald Trump won voters who did not go to college. When you look at who is on Medicaid, when you look at who is on food stamps, when you look at who needs expanded health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, it is concentrated in this group of voters who thought Trump was going to make their cost of living cheaper for them.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">在美国政治中，过去的情况是民主党以较大优势赢得年收入低于 5 万美元的选民，而共和党则以较大优势赢得年收入超过 10 万美元的选民。因此，我们过去常常在社会保障网络问题上发生争执，但这些争执在某种程度上与政治联盟相一致。共和党人希望削减这类福利，但这些福利的受益者大多不是他们的选民。而在 2024 年，唐纳德·特朗普赢得了年收入低于 5 万美元的选民。虽然在这部分选民中并非大获全胜，但他确实赢了他们。唐纳德·特朗普赢得了没有上过大学的选民。当你观察谁在使用医疗补助计划，谁在领取食品券，谁需要《平价医疗法案》下扩大的健康保险补贴时，你会发现这些人主要集中在那些认为特朗普会降低他们生活成本的选民群体中。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Yes. Higher tariffs, right? There are many ways in which this administration and allies in Congress have run a pretty regressive agenda, not looking out for the common man, shall we say. I mean, we haven't even talked about some of the other dodgy cuts recently, like closing half of the regional Head Start offices. Head Start is the program that serves low-income families by providing pre-K and child care and other ancillary services for the parents. My question will be at what point do Americans necessarily connect the dots? I think with tariffs, people understand the tariffs are happening. Some of these other connections I think are a little bit more opaque and some of that is of necessity and some of it I think is by design. Like one of my most deeply held political beliefs is that complexity rewards demagogues and this bill is definitely a case in point. Like budgets are always complicated and make people's eyes glaze over, but normally journalists have some time to digest what's in it and help people understand how it might affect them. Instead, all of this stuff is being dumped at once. So, it's very easy to lie about like Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are just looking out for you and are going to make you rich and are going to kick off all of those freeloaders and welfare queens from programs so that you get them and they don't. And it's an easier story to tell the more opaque the actual policies are.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。更高的关税，对吧？本届政府及其国会盟友在很多方面都推行了相当倒退的议程，可以说并没有照顾到普通民众。我的意思是，我们甚至还没有谈到最近其他一些可疑的削减，比如关闭了一半的地区“启智计划”（Head Start）办公室。“启智计划”是为低收入家庭提供学前教育、儿童保育以及为家长提供其他辅助服务的项目。我的问题是，美国人究竟在什么时候才会把这些点联系起来？我认为对于关税，人们明白关税正在发生。而其他一些联系，我认为则更加不透明，其中一些是必然的，另一些我认为是刻意设计的。比如我最坚定的政治信念之一就是，复杂性会奖赏煽动者，而这项法案就是一个典型的例子。预算总是很复杂，让人看得眼花缭乱，但通常记者会有一些时间来消化其中的内容，并帮助人们理解它可能如何影响他们。但现在，所有这些东西都是一次性抛出来的。所以，很容易撒谎说唐纳德·特朗普和国会共和党人只是在为你着想，会让你致富，会把所有那些占便宜的人和“福利女王”从项目中剔除，这样你就能得到福利而他们得不到。实际政策越不透明，这样的故事就越容易讲述。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">It's why I've thought a fight happening as we speak, and we don't know how it'll resolve yet, is interesting. So the bill as initially written has the work requirements come into play in 2029, after the next presidential election. So they get to pocket these assumed savings because we do budget numbers over 10 years. But in theory, nobody will feel the thing they are doing to Medicaid until 2029, or at least that thing they are doing to Medicaid. But the more right-wing members of their caucus want that brought up to 2026, in which case people would begin to feel it immediately within this term, such that it could be something that people are upset about come the next presidential election. Again, we don't know how it'll play out, but I thought it was quite telling that the Republican majority's preference, not their sort of more Freedom Caucus minority, was let's put this in the bill, but make it the next president's problem. Because you can lie about things until you're thrown off of Medicaid and a bunch of people are thrown off of Medicaid, and then what just happened comes clear real quickly.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">这就是为什么我认为，我们正在谈论的这场争斗——我们还不知道它将如何解决——很有意思。最初起草的法案规定工作要求在 2029 年，也就是下一次总统选举之后生效。这样他们就能将这些预期的节省收入囊中，因为我们是按 10 年的预算数字来计算的。但理论上，在 2029 年之前，没有人会感受到他们对医疗补助计划所做的事情，或者至少是他们对医疗补助计划所做的这件事。但是他们党团中更右翼的成员希望将其提前到 2026 年，这样人们就会在任期内立即感受到影响，从而可能成为下一次总统选举时人们感到不满的事情。再说一次，我们不知道结果会如何，但我认为共和党多数派的偏好——而不是他们那种更偏向自由党团的少数派——是“让我们把这个写进法案，但让它成为下一任总统的问题”，这一点非常能说明问题。因为你可以一直撒谎，直到你被踢出医疗补助计划，并且一大群人被踢出医疗补助计划，然后刚刚发生的事情就会很快变得清晰起来。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Yes. Well, there's this fundamental tension within the Republican caucus, as you pointed out, between members who think that the provisions are not heartless enough and those who think that they are too heartless in the political sense, I guess, in that the people on the budget committee, we should say when we're recording this, we don't know what concessions were given to them as yet in order to get the bill out of committee. But the people who voted against it initially said that they wanted these Medicaid work requirements to be moved up. They wanted more of the climate-related tax credits to be rescinded, etc. But then there are a lot of other members of the party who are very worried about exactly the political risk you identified, that people will realize they've been kicked off of these benefits and will take their anger, justified anger, out on the Republican party and whoever's on the Republican ticket. And this is a problem not only in the House but it's a problem in the Senate. I think you mentioned Josh Hawley has talked about this. Hawley seems to be against Medicaid cuts at high levels altogether. And he's making the argument that I sort of just alluded to. We are now a working-class party. It is our voters on Medicaid.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。嗯，正如你指出的，共和党党团内部存在这种根本性的紧张关系，一部分成员认为这些条款还不够无情，另一部分则认为它们在政治意义上过于无情，我想，预算委员会的那些人——我们应该说，在我们录制这个的时候，我们还不知道为了让法案通过委员会，他们获得了哪些让步。但最初投票反对的人表示，他们希望将这些医疗补助工作要求提前。他们希望取消更多与气候相关的税收抵免等等。但是，党内还有很多其他成员非常担心你所指出的那种政治风险，即人们会意识到他们被剥夺了这些福利，并将他们的愤怒——正当的愤怒——发泄到共和党和共和党候选人身上。这不仅是众议院的问题，也是参议院的问题。我想你提到乔什·霍利谈过这个问题。霍利似乎完全反对高层削减医疗补助。他提出的论点正是我刚才间接提到的：我们现在是一个工人阶级政党，使用医疗补助的是我们的选民。</p>

That's the mechanism.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。他们对于以这种方式削减医疗补助会发生什么并不感到困惑。他们知道，人们……这种做法省钱的唯一方式，或者说主要方式，是那些本可以走进医院或医生办公室，出示医疗补助卡并获得政府支付的医疗保险的人，现在无法这样做了。这就是机制。</p>

                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Yes. So, there are members of the Republican conference who want these Medicaid cuts to kick in faster. There are members who want them to kick in more slowly or maybe not at all because they understand that it is their voters who may suffer. There are members of the party who don't want to raise deficits. There are members of the party who think that deficits don't matter. There are just like, the part of the issue here and part of the reason why I have been really wondering like where does this bill actually go is that there are so many mutually exclusive constraints in a party that has a very thin margin that it's hard to know who gets to extract what demands in exchange for their vote because like we haven't, we haven't really talked about Republicans who are in, you know, the SALT caucus who want basically bigger tax cuts for rich people by allowing people in blue states, predominantly blue states, to deduct more of their state and local taxes. And they may be the defining, you know, it seems like the people who are worried about Medicaid cuts hurting their own constituents, they've gotten a little quieter recently. The SALT Caucus is now louder. So maybe they're the ones who get to, you know, twist the bill in their direction, but then it's going to cost even more. And what do you do about that and be more aggressive and be more aggressive and do you end up having the bill cost more? Do you end up kicking even more people off of benefits? I don't know. Like these puzzle pieces just don't fit together.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。所以，共和党党团中有成员希望这些医疗补助削减更快生效。也有成员希望它们更慢生效，或者根本不生效，因为他们明白受苦的可能是他们的选民。党内有成员不希望增加赤字，也有成员认为赤字无关紧要。这里的问题部分在于，也是我一直纳闷这项法案究竟走向何方的原因之一，在于一个在非常微弱多数的政党中，存在着如此多相互排斥的制约因素，以至于很难知道谁能通过投票换取哪些要求。比如我们还没有真正谈到那些在所谓的“州和地方税收抵扣（SALT）核心小组”中的共和党人，他们基本上希望通过允许蓝州（主要是蓝州）的人们抵扣更多的州和地方税收，来为富人争取更大的减税。他们可能起着决定性作用，你知道，那些担心医疗补助削减会伤害自己选民的人，最近似乎安静了一些。“SALT 核心小组”现在声音更大了。所以也许是他们能够，你知道，把法案往他们的方向扭转，但那样成本就会更高。那你该怎么办，变得更激进，更激进，最终导致法案成本更高吗？最终会把更多人踢出福利体系吗？我不知道。这些拼图碎片根本拼不起来。</p>

                <p class="english-text">Um, this was one of the few times I think I've seen his friends and allies in Congress like visibly recoil and many of them said publicly, "Yeah, that's not a good idea." And so Trump then posted on social media, "Well, I think they should do it, but it's probably a bad idea. So, I kind of understand if they don't." This is one of the few times I feel like I've seen Donald Trump back down in one of these fights. And, um, you know, it's clear that this was in the no-fly zone. It was just interesting to see this vestigial reflex of the Republican party as I understood it to exist in 2013 kick in. And the one thing Donald Trump cannot do as he tries to build his working-class multi-racial coalition is the most popular policy move in his arsenal for a bill like this, which is to pay for some of your tax cuts by raising taxes on rich people.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，这是我为数不多几次看到他在国会的朋友和盟友明显退缩，他们中的许多人公开表示：“是的，这不是个好主意。”于是特朗普随后在社交媒体上发帖说：“嗯，我认为他们应该这样做，但这可能不是个好主意。所以，如果他们不这样做，我有点理解。”这是我为数不多几次感觉到唐纳德·特朗普在这样的争斗中退缩了。而且，嗯，你知道，很明显这属于禁区。看到共和党这种我理解中在 2013 年还存在的残余本能反应出来，真是很有意思。而唐纳德·特朗普在试图建立他的工人阶级多种族联盟时，有一件事他做不到，那就是在他针对这类法案的政策武器库中最受欢迎的一招：通过对富人增税来为部分减税买单。</p>

                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Well, you said the one thing that holds the Republican party together is fealty to Trump. I think it's fealty to Trump and tax cuts, particularly regressive tax cuts. This has been their north star for many, many years. And it does not surprise me that that's their one red line with this guy is that we cannot raise taxes on higher income people and corporations.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，你说维系共和党的唯一因素是对特朗普的忠诚。我认为是对特朗普的忠诚和减税，特别是累退性减税。这多年来一直是他们的指路明灯。所以他们对这个人设下的唯一红线是不能对高收入人群和公司增税，这并不让我感到惊讶。</p>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">So Donald Trump wins the election running against the high prices of the Biden era and he walks into an economy where inflation has calmed down, things are pretty steady and stable. Stock market's in good shape. And then he begins raising prices through tariffs. And the tariffs are bouncing around a lot. Right now we're on a reduced level with China for 90 days as we negotiate, only a mere 30%. Yes. But there are tariffs now on all kinds of goods coming from all over the world. Those price increases are starting to show up, are going to continue showing up. There's also a huge amount of uncertainty pausing all kinds of business investment because when you don't know what the tariff rate or tax structure will be from day to day, you're not going to make a bunch of long-term capital investments. So, every forecaster says that the risk of recession has been rising from what they anticipated it would be at the beginning of the year. Now you get a bill like this where we're doing things like cutting SNAP, cutting Medicaid, cutting the Affordable Care Act. How do those two things interact?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">所以唐纳德·特朗普通过反对拜登时代的高物价赢得了选举，然后他接手了一个通货膨胀已经平息、形势相当稳定和安定的经济。股市状况良好。然后他开始通过关税提高价格。关税波动很大。目前我们与中国达成了为期 90 天的较低关税水平，以便进行谈判，仅仅是 30%。是的。但现在对来自世界各地的各种商品都征收了关税。这些价格上涨已经开始显现，并将继续显现。此外，巨大的不确定性也导致各种商业投资暂停，因为当你不知道每天的关税税率或税收结构会是什么样时，你就不会进行大量长期资本投资。因此，所有预测者都表示，经济衰退的风险比年初预期的要高。现在你又得到了这样一项法案，我们正在做诸如削减补充营养援助计划（SNAP）、削减医疗补助计划（Medicaid）、削减《平价医疗法案》（Affordable Care Act）之类的事情。这两者之间是如何相互作用的？</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">I think it's never really a great time to kick a lot of people off of critical benefits like Medicaid and SNAP. But probably the worst time is when we are about to head into a recession because A, that's when people are most likely to need these programs and they automatically kick in and so there's a little bit of, you know, it's the safety net, that's what the safety net is, right? It's to catch people when they might otherwise be falling, to help them get back on their feet. These programs also, because they kick in automatically, they're thought of as automatically stabilizing the overall economy because if all of these people who were losing their jobs at once stopped spending at once, that's going to lead to kind of a downward spiral. They stopped spending, the places that they would spend their money stop hiring, lay off people, etc., etc. But it's effectively like an automatic form of stimulus and helps the economy recover a little faster. If instead you have these things coinciding at once where we have a recession on the one hand and these massive changes to programs like food stamps and Medicaid on the other, then you will have not only greater suffering among individuals in the near term but potentially a deeper and longer recession. And look, I really, I don't think a recession is a fait accompli, you know, I don't want to suggest that it's definitely going to happen, but the odds have increased and all of these agenda items are conspiring to make life a lot more difficult, whether intentionally or otherwise, a lot more difficult for the most vulnerable Americans because again, the tariffs will also increase the prices of the things that they buy. So yeah, it's like it's the perfect storm.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我认为，把很多人从像医疗补助计划（Medicaid）和补充营养援助计划（SNAP）这样的关键福利中剔除，从来都不是一个好时机。但最糟糕的时机可能是在我们即将陷入经济衰退的时候，因为首先，那是人们最可能需要这些项目的时候，它们会自动启动，所以这有点像，你知道，安全网，这就是安全网的作用，对吧？它是在人们可能跌倒时接住他们，帮助他们重新站起来。这些项目也因为它们会自动启动，被认为是能够自动稳定整体经济的，因为如果所有这些同时失业的人都同时停止消费，那就会导致一种恶性循环。他们停止消费，他们会花钱的地方停止招聘，裁员等等。但这实际上就像一种自动的刺激形式，帮助经济更快地复苏。如果相反，我们同时面临经济衰退，以及对食品券和医疗补助等项目进行大规模调整，那么短期内不仅个人会遭受更大的痛苦，而且可能会出现更深、更持久的经济衰退。而且你看，我真的不认为经济衰退是既成事实，你知道，我不想暗示它一定会发生，但可能性增加了，所有这些议程项目都在合谋让生活变得更加困难，无论是有意还是无意，对最脆弱的美国人来说都更加困难，因为再说一次，关税也会提高他们购买物品的价格。所以是的，这就像一场完美风暴。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">So Republicans will tell you that this whole conversation is unfair, that we're ignoring all the ways in this bill that they are expanding help for the working class. So there is a somewhat complicated approach to expanding the child tax credit. There are things like no tax on tips, no tax on overtime. Talk to me about this set of policies, the more populist dimensions of this bill.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">所以共和党人会告诉你，整个对话是不公平的，我们忽略了这项法案中他们扩大对工人阶级帮助的所有方式。比如，有一个有些复杂的扩大儿童税收抵免的方法。还有像小费免税、加班费免税之类的措施。跟我谈谈这一系列政策，这项法案中更具民粹主义色彩的方面。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">So, I don't think they're uniformly bad, all of the things that you just mentioned. I do think that we should be doing something to make more assistance available to families with kids, for example. But the way that they have structured these changes is still not really targeting those who need it. So just as an example, the no tax on tips thing, it sounds like that would help your typical waitress or other hospitality worker. In reality, those people are probably low income enough that they're not going to benefit from this because their income is below the threshold where they would get taxed much anyway, whether that income is coming from tips or from wages. The people who are going to benefit are going to be the people who are disproportionately high income who can maybe reclassify more of their income as tips or as overtime. So this is going to be like a big boondoggle for accountants and tax attorneys, and we've gutted the IRS and the checking on tax shenanigans are going down, right? So this is not structured in such a way that it will actually help the people that I think are being envisioned. When you think about tipped workers or you think about people who need overtime pay, they are probably going to see very little benefit or at least relative to where the dollars are actually going to be flowing. It's primarily going to help higher income people. The same thing with like social security cutting or eliminating taxes on social security. Most people under current law like who are low income already are not paying taxes on social security. The people who are left out of the current system who would be exempt are disproportionately higher income because of how the law currently works. So, a lot of these things that sort of sound populist on their face are either symbolic or actually going to be regressive.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">所以，我不认为你刚才提到的所有事情都一无是处。我确实认为我们应该做些什么，例如为有孩子的家庭提供更多援助。但是他们构建这些变革的方式仍然没有真正针对那些有需要的人。举个例子，小费免税这件事，听起来似乎会帮助典型的女服务员或其他酒店业员工。但实际上，这些人的收入可能已经足够低，以至于他们不会从中受益，因为他们的收入低于无论如何都会被征收很多税的门槛，无论这些收入是来自小费还是工资。真正受益的将是那些不成比例地高收入的人，他们也许可以将其更多的收入重新归类为小费或加班费。所以这将会成为会计师和税务律师的一大福利，而且我们已经削弱了国税局，对税务舞弊的检查也在减少，对吧？所以这种结构并不能真正帮助那些我认为被设想为受益者的人。当你想到小费工人或者想到那些需要加班费的人时，他们可能只会看到很少的利益，或者至少相对于资金实际流向而言是这样。这主要会帮助高收入人群。同样的情况也适用于削减或取消社会保障税。根据现行法律，大多数低收入人群已经不在缴纳社会保障税了。而那些被排除在当前体系之外、本应获得豁免的人，由于现行法律的运作方式，不成比例地是高收入人群。所以，很多这些表面上听起来很民粹主义的事情，要么是象征性的，要么实际上是累退的。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">And it will also distort a lot of behavior, too. Like, I should tell the Washington Post to just pay me 100% in tips and then, you know, all of my income will be tax-free. Um, one of the other ways they're trying to pay for part of this is gutting various tax credits to incentivize clean energy that were in the Inflation Reduction Act. This is another part of the bill under active negotiation. The right-wing of the Republican party wants to make the evisceration of these tax cuts quite complete. The bill as it is currently written just makes it profound is where I put it. But solar credits, wind credits, tax cuts for electric vehicles, nuclear, which in general one tends to think about the Republican party supporting. Putting aside even what you think about climate change, okay, these were fast growing, are fast growing American industries and they are industries we don't want to lose to China, right? We have big tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles for a reason. Donald Trump has wanted to bring down American energy prices and wants American energy dominance. These are things that generate energy and, you know, contribute to an overall capacity. How do you think about what this will mean just for the energy prices and the industries behind them?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">而且这也会扭曲很多行为。比如，我应该告诉《华盛顿邮报》把我 100% 的工资都以小费形式支付，然后，你知道，我所有的收入就都免税了。嗯，他们试图为部分法案买单的另一种方式是大幅削减《通货膨胀削减法案》中各种激励清洁能源的税收抵免。这是法案中另一个正在积极谈判的部分。共和党右翼希望彻底废除这些税收减免。目前法案的写法，在我看来，只是使其影响深远。但是太阳能抵免、风能抵免、电动汽车税收减免、核能——人们通常认为共和党会支持这些。即使抛开你对气候变化的看法，好吧，这些曾经是、现在也是快速增长的美国产业，而且是我们不希望输给中国的产业，对吧？我们对中国电动汽车征收高额关税是有原因的。唐纳德·特朗普一直希望降低美国能源价格，并希望美国在能源领域占据主导地位。这些都是能够产生能源并有助于提升整体产能的东西。你认为这对能源价格及其背后的产业意味着什么？</p>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Well, and a lot of the investments have to date been concentrated in red districts as well. I mean, my general view on so-called clean energy, green energy, whatever term you want to use, is that the transition is coming no matter what. Just because the economics in the long run make much more sense for electrifying everything and to use solar and wind and other renewables as much as possible because like on the margin, sunshine and wind are free and fossil fuels are not. So it's going to win in the long run. The question is only how quickly and politicians can do things to either speed it up or slow it down. And if they slow it down, that means we are just delaying the time until we get the really, really cheap, not to mention cleaner and more renewable energy, and raising costs effectively in the near term.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">嗯，而且迄今为止，很多投资也集中在共和党控制的地区。我的意思是，我对所谓的清洁能源、绿色能源，无论你用什么术语，总的看法是，无论如何，转型都会到来。仅仅因为从长远来看，经济学上将一切电气化，并尽可能多地使用太阳能、风能和其他可再生能源更有意义，因为边际上，阳光和风是免费的，而化石燃料不是。所以从长远来看，它会胜出。问题只在于速度有多快，而政客们可以采取措施来加速或减缓它。如果他们减缓它，那就意味着我们只是在推迟获得真正廉价、更不用说更清洁和更可再生的能源的时间，并在短期内有效地提高了成本。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">But it does something else too, which is that there is a race to have the dominant corporate players in what will be globally important export industries. That's also true. As you say, there's a transition going on. It's probably going to happen one way or the other. And China, who we are obsessed with competing with and for reasonable reasons, they've pumped a huge amount of money into trying to dominate solar technology, trying to dominate wind technology, battery technology, EVs. So, putting aside again what you think of renewable energy, and my opinions on it are exactly what one would think they are. This is a gigantic gift to China where their electric vehicle industry is already quite globally competitive. We are keeping those cars out for a reason. We worry if they come in they would beat the cars we are making. But now nobody likes Tesla in Europe and we, nobody, like liberals don't like Tesla in America increasingly, and we are like cutting the knees out of our other electric vehicle companies which are using these kinds of credits to catch up. And to be really good at solar, wind and nuclear, you got to fund it. And we're going to stop doing that, too. Just from their industrial policy strategy, this just seems disastrous for us.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">但它还有另一个作用，那就是在全球重要的出口产业中，存在着一场争夺主导企业地位的竞赛。这也是事实。正如你所说，转型正在进行中，它可能会以这样或那样的方式发生。而中国——我们执着于与之竞争，并且有合理的理由——他们投入了巨额资金试图主导太阳能技术、风能技术、电池技术和电动汽车。所以，再次抛开你对可再生能源的看法——而我对它的看法正是人们所能想到的那样——这对中国来说是一份巨大的礼物，他们的电动汽车产业在全球已经相当有竞争力了。我们阻止这些汽车进入是有原因的，我们担心如果它们进来会击败我们制造的汽车。但现在欧洲没人喜欢特斯拉，我们，没人，比如美国的自由派越来越不喜欢特斯拉，而我们却像是在削弱我们其他电动汽车公司的竞争力，这些公司正在利用这类信贷来追赶。要想在太阳能、风能和核能方面做得非常好，你就必须投入资金。而我们也将停止这样做了。仅从他们的产业政策策略来看，这对我们来说似乎是灾难性的。</p>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Yes, I generally agree with that. I mean, I think I am more skeptical of industrial policy more generally than you are. And I thought that the tariffs we placed on not just Chinese solar but global solar back in whatever it was, 2018, and then extended under Biden, I thought those were dumb. Like if other countries want to sell us solar on the cheap, let them. Let us have cheap clean energy.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的，我基本同意这一点。我的意思是，我认为我对产业政策的怀疑程度比你更普遍。而且我认为，我们在 2018 年（或其他什么时候）对中国太阳能乃至全球太阳能征收的关税，然后在拜登政府时期延长了，我认为那些都很愚蠢。比如，如果其他国家想廉价地向我们出售太阳能，那就让他们卖吧。让我们拥有廉价的清洁能源。</p>

                <p class="english-text">Okay. And I agree with you that this set of policies is again somewhat at odds with Trump's general pro-manufacturing renaissance agenda. Like why are we talking about bringing back sneaker factories and maybe doll factories at this point? I'm not really sure. Like very low-value items. If we are going to use industrial policy to try to revive or invest in some segment of the manufacturing industry, we should be doing it for these goods of the future.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">好的。我同意你的看法，这一系列政策再次与特朗普总体的支持制造业复兴议程有些不符。比如，我们现在为什么要谈论恢复运动鞋工厂，或许还有娃娃工厂？我不太确定。这些都是价值很低的商品。如果我们要利用产业政策来试图复兴或投资制造业的某个领域，我们应该为这些未来的商品这样做。</p>

                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">So this gets to another form of redistribution that you brought up at the beginning and I wanted to end on, which is the redistribution from the young to the old. And there's a way that the climate side does this very directly. If we are slowing down that transition, volatile climate are going to experience more harm from that. But you're making a bigger point about the bill. The bill from an administration that prides itself on being pro-natalist and being pro-kids and wanting to see more kids in America. Walk me through that form of redistribution.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">这就涉及到你一开始提到的另一种再分配形式，我想以此结束，那就是从年轻人向老年人的再分配。气候方面以一种非常直接的方式实现了这一点。如果我们减缓这种转型，不稳定的气候将因此遭受更大的损害。但你对这项法案提出了一个更重要的观点。这项法案来自一个以支持生育、支持儿童并希望在美国看到更多孩子而自豪的政府。请详细解释一下这种再分配形式。</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">So there are a number of ways in which babies and kids are basically getting shafted. One is again sort of where we started out talking about who pays back the debt. At some point this debt is going to be repaid, will have to be repaid by future generations of Americans in the either in the form of higher taxes or fewer benefits. So that's going to be today's kids. That's like a very basic point. But we are also doing a bunch of things to disinvest in their healthcare, disinvest in their nutritional development by taking away some of these again critical safety net benefits that do have a payoff over the long run. And then there are other like random things in the bill that just seem to be bizarrely, like I don't know, exacting cruelty upon kids for no apparent reason. Like again, this is really in the weeds, but already on Medicaid, Medicaid dollars, federal Medicaid dollars cannot be used to pay for undocumented people. Some states will use their own funds to provide health insurance to children regardless of immigration status. And the bill says if you do that, if you use your own funds to pay for these kids, then we are going to strip away all of this other money. So, it's like they're basically incentivizing states to take health insurance away from children. The child tax credit is another good example of this. Again, it's like buried in the bill. Probably very few people have realized it's in there. Even though they say they are making it more generous, they're making it more generous, but basically for higher income people, and they are taking it away from a lot of children. And the way that they're doing that is that they're saying if either of a child's parents doesn't have a social security number, the child is not eligible for the child tax credit. And this does not only affect kids who might have an undocumented parent, it also affects kids who might have one parent who's here legally, too. Like if you're on a student visa, you generally can't get a social security number. So if you imagine like a US citizen has a kid with somebody who is in their grad school class, their child will not be eligible for the child tax credit whereas in the past they would have been. And there's also a marriage penalty built into all of this, too. Like, if the parents in that example don't get married, then the US citizen parent can claim the kid and get the credit, but if they get married, they lose it altogether. So, there's like a bunch of like little things in the bill that just basically take a lot of resources away from kids in some ways, big and small, especially, you know, children of immigrants, but not only children of immigrants. Cost shifting more of food stamps onto the states that will disproportionately hurt kids because kids make up a huge chunk of the food stamp receiving population. So there are a bunch of things like that and I think that that kind of gets lost in all of this.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">所以，婴儿和孩子们在很多方面基本上都受到了不公平的对待。其中之一又回到了我们开始讨论的谁来偿还债务的问题。在某个时候，这笔债务将不得不由未来的美国人以更高的税收或更少的福利的形式来偿还。所以这将是今天的孩子们。这是一个非常基本的观点。但我们也在做很多事情，通过剥夺一些对长期而言确实有回报的关键社会保障网络福利，来减少对他们医疗保健的投资，减少对他们营养发展的投资。然后法案中还有其他一些随机的事情，看起来非常奇怪，我不知道，就像无缘无故地对孩子们施加残酷对待。比如，这真的很细枝末节，但在医疗补助计划中，医疗补助资金，联邦医疗补助资金不能用于支付无证人员的费用。一些州会使用自己的资金为儿童提供健康保险，无论其移民身份如何。而法案规定，如果你这样做，如果你用自己的资金为这些孩子支付费用，那么我们将剥夺所有这些其他的资金。所以，这基本上是在激励各州剥夺儿童的健康保险。儿童税收抵免是另一个很好的例子。再说一次，这就像埋在法案里一样，可能很少有人意识到它在那里。尽管他们说他们正在使其更慷慨，但他们使其更慷慨，基本上是针对高收入人群，而且他们正在从很多孩子那里夺走它。他们这样做的方式是说，如果孩子的父母中任何一方没有社会安全号码，那么孩子就没有资格获得儿童税收抵免。这不仅影响那些可能有无证父母的孩子，也影响那些可能有一个合法居住在这里的父母的孩子。比如，如果你持有学生签证，你通常无法获得社会安全号码。所以如果你想象一个美国公民和他们研究生班上的某个人生了孩子，他们的孩子将没有资格获得儿童税收抵免，而在过去他们本可以获得。而且这里面还内置了婚姻惩罚。比如，在那个例子中，如果父母没有结婚，那么美国公民父母可以申报孩子并获得抵免，但如果他们结婚了，他们就完全失去了。所以，法案中有很多这样的小事情，基本上在某些方面，无论大小，都从孩子那里夺走了大量资源，特别是，你知道，移民的孩子，但不仅仅是移民的孩子。将更多的食品券成本转移到各州，这将不成比例地伤害儿童，因为儿童占食品券领取人口的很大一部分。所以有很多这样的事情，我认为这些在所有这一切中都被忽略了。</p>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-ezra">
                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">I think that's important though because if you look at also where the bill spends new money, one of the places that it spends new money is inflicting pain and accelerating deportation among immigrants. So, there's $45 billion through 2029 for ICE detention facilities. It's a 365% increase annually from where it is now. $14 billion through 2029 for ICE transportation and removal operations, a 500% increase. So you're seeing them as they cut Medicaid, as they cut the Affordable Care Act, as they cut green energy subsidies, they're spending a bunch of money on funding the machines and architecture for deportation, for detainment, for, you know, part of if you begin thinking about other things you've heard from Stephen Miller about suspending due process and for things that could get very scary. It has been a complaint to the administration that they don't have the resources to do mass deportation and confinement right now. This bill is meant to give them that money.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">但我认为这很重要，因为如果你也看看法案在哪里花了新的钱，其中一个花新钱的地方就是给移民施加痛苦并加速驱逐出境。因此，到 2029 年，将有 450 亿美元用于移民和海关执法局（ICE）的拘留设施，这比现在每年增加了 365%。到 2029 年，将有 140 亿美元用于 ICE 的运输和遣返行动，增加了 500%。所以你看到他们，在削减医疗补助计划、削减《平价医疗法案》、削减绿色能源补贴的同时，却在花费大量资金资助驱逐出境、拘留的机器和架构，你知道，如果你开始思考你从斯蒂芬·米勒那里听到的关于暂停正当程序以及其他可能变得非常可怕的事情，这只是其中的一部分。政府一直抱怨他们目前没有足够的资源进行大规模驱逐和监禁。这项法案旨在给他们这笔钱。</p>

                <p class="english-text">Yes. And look, because yes, this is a very scary expansion of the detention industrial complex. The other, the one piece of all of this that I do want to make sure I emphasize is that, you know, Trump says he's going after gang bangers and criminals and drug dealers and whatever. And those are the people who are getting locked up. Those are the, you know, with this image conjured up of like these are people living in the shadows committing crimes. He's actually been trying to deport a lot of people who have permission to be here and or had, I should say, permission to be here. He is basically de-documenting people to create a larger illegal population or unauthorized population by taking away legal status or, you know, various kinds of temporary legal status that people have. He has stripped Afghans, Venezuelans, a lot of other populations of the protections that they had against deportation, their ability to work legally, be here legally, work legally. So he is basically manifesting this, um, you know, scary fantasy that he had been portraying for many years that we are being overrun with people who are not allowed to be here and he's now saying, "No, you've now broken the law," but he basically forced them to break the law by taking away their protections.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。而且你看，因为是的，这是拘留产业复合体非常可怕的扩张。另外，我想强调的一点是，你知道，特朗普说他要打击黑帮分子、罪犯、毒贩等等。而那些被关押起来的人，就是那些，你知道，伴随着这种被描绘成的生活在阴影中犯罪的形象的人。他实际上一直在试图驱逐很多有权在这里居住的人，或者我应该说，曾经有权在这里居住的人。他基本上是在通过剥夺人们的合法身份或各种临时合法身份，来“去文件化”人们，从而制造一个更大的非法或未经授权的人口。他剥夺了阿富汗人、委内瑞拉人以及许多其他人群本应享有的免于驱逐的保护，以及他们合法工作、合法居留、合法工作的能力。所以他基本上是在实现他多年来所描绘的那种可怕的幻想，即我们正被不允许在这里的人淹没，而他现在却说：“不，你们现在违法了”，但他基本上是通过剥夺他们的保护来迫使他们违法的。</p>

                <p class="speaker-name">Ezra Klein:</p>
                <p class="english-text">I think this gets to this bigger picture we've been tracking a bit during this conversation. Budgets are a way we make certain goals possible to achieve and other goals impossible to achieve. They're statements of our values. So tax cuts for people in general, rich people in particular, definitely. Check. Protecting Medicaid and healthcare for working-class people, which you have heard them talk about. Nope. Medicaid is getting gutted. The sort of whole "we're a working-class coalition now," not so much. Keeping prices down between the tariffs and how much more people will pay as we shift health insurance costs onto them and off of the government. We're not keeping prices down. Cutting budget deficits, which people around Trump have talked a lot about how unsustainable our fiscal picture is. This bill is a disaster. But the Stephen Miller mass deportation agenda, the immigration side of this administration and its promises, that is really getting served here. I mean, the thing that this, the promises we're keeping here are tax cuts tilted towards rich people and building a huge engine, funding a huge machinery of de-documentation, as you, I think, correctly put it, deportation and detention. Those are our values. I guess that's the budget. Those are our values.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我认为这触及了我们在这段对话中一直在追踪的更宏大的图景。预算是我们使某些目标得以实现而另一些目标无法实现的方式。它们是我们价值观的体现。所以，为普通人减税，特别是为富人减税，绝对是。✓。保护工人阶级的医疗补助和医疗保健，你听他们谈论过。✕。医疗补助计划正在被大幅削减。那种“我们现在是工人阶级联盟”的说法，不太成立。在关税和我们将健康保险成本从政府转移到个人身上导致人们支付更多费用的情况下，保持物价稳定。我们没有保持物价稳定。削减预算赤字，特朗普周围的人一直在谈论我们的财政状况是多么不可持续。这项法案是一场灾难。但是斯蒂芬·米勒的大规模驱逐议程，本届政府在移民方面的承诺，在这里确实得到了满足。我的意思是，这件事，我们在这里信守的承诺是向富人倾斜的减税，以及建立一个巨大的引擎，资助一个巨大的“去文件化”——我认为你用词准确——驱逐和拘留的机器。这些就是我们的价值观。我想这就是预算。这些就是我们的价值观。</p>

                <p class="english-text">I wish they were more clearly communicated to the public. But again, the fact that this bill has come together so quickly, it's over a thousand pages long, should tell you how much they actually want the public to learn about what is in this agenda.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我希望他们能更清楚地向公众传达这些。但再说一次，这项法案如此迅速地出台，长达一千多页，这应该能告诉你他们实际上有多希望公众了解这项议程的内容。</p>

                <p class="english-text">I think that's a good place to end. Always our final question. What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">我想这是一个很好的结束点。总是我们的最后一个问题：你会向听众推荐哪三本书？</p>

            <div class="dialogue-entry speaker-catherine">
                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Okay, so I was thinking about the right three to recommend and I'm going to give you three very different titles. Currently I am reading Ken Rogoff's book, "Our Dollar, Your Problem," which has like a sweeping history of how the dollar became the global reserve currency and how much of that was about luck and whether that will persist. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm really enjoying it right now. My second recommendation would be "Demon Copperhead" by Barbara Kingsolver, which came out a couple of years ago and I think won the Pulitzer and it's a beautiful novel that's loosely based or sort of an update of "David Copperfield" that I think besides being, you know, extraordinarily written has some tremendous political insights in it as well. I don't know if you have read it?</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">好的，我一直在思考推荐哪三本合适的书，我会给你三个非常不同的书名。目前我正在读肯·罗格夫的《我们的美元，你的问题》(Our Dollar, Your Problem)，这本书全面地讲述了美元如何成为全球储备货币的历史，其中有多少是运气成分，以及这种情况是否会持续下去。我还没读完，但我现在非常喜欢这本书。我的第二个推荐是芭芭拉·金索尔弗的《恶魔铜头》(Demon Copperhead)，这本书几年前出版，我想它获得了普利策奖，这是一部优美的小说，大致基于或可以说是《大卫·科波菲尔》的更新版，我认为除了文笔非凡之外，它还包含了一些深刻的政治见解。不知道你读过没有？</p>

                <p class="speaker-name">Catherine Rampell:</p>
                <p class="english-text">Yeah. You know about sort of resentment among there. She doesn't describe them as Trump voters in her book, but some of them could be recognizable as like the Trump voter in the diner archetype. And then my third recommendation is going to be "Shy," which is the musical composer Mary Rodgers's memoir published posthumously with Jesse Green who is the theater critic here at the Times. And people who know me well know that I'm a big theater nerd. And I loved this book. It's like very dishy. There's a lot in it about, you know, mid-20th century gossip from Broadway and how she dated Stephen Sondheim, who recently passed away but was not known for, you know, being attracted to women and how all of that went and it's just a delightful, delightful gossipy memoir. So definitely recommend that.</p>
                <p class="chinese-text">是的。你知道那里存在的那种怨恨情绪。她在书中没有将他们描述为特朗普选民，但其中一些人可以被识别为那种餐馆里的特朗普选民原型。然后我的第三个推荐是《害羞》(Shy)，这是音乐作曲家玛丽·罗杰斯的回忆录，在她去世后与《纽约时报》的戏剧评论家杰西·格林共同出版。了解我的人都知道我是个戏剧迷。我非常喜欢这本书，内容非常八卦。里面有很多关于，你知道，20 世纪中期百老汇的八卦，以及她如何与斯蒂芬·桑德海姆约会——他最近去世了，但并不以吸引女性而闻名——以及所有这些事情的经过，这真是一本令人愉快的、充满八卦的回忆录。所以绝对推荐这本书。</p>
