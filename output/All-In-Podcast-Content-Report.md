# All-In Podcast 内容报告

本报告整理自“All-In
Podcast”的一期节目，内容涵盖债券市场危机、共和党对D.O.G.E.（政府效能部）议程的放弃、谷歌利用人工智能颠覆搜索、OpenAI
收购 Jony Ive 的 IO
公司以及能源解决方案等多个热门话题。以下为节目主要对话内容的逐字记录及中文翻译。

## 开场与峰会预告

<div class="dialogue">

JCal (Jason Calacanis):

All right, everybody. Welcome back to the number one podcast in the
world, the All-In podcast. Today, the original squad is back. No guests,
just Full Contact Sachs is back. We're going to break down a number of
topics today, including chaos in the bond market as Republicans
seemingly have abandoned the D.O.G.E. agenda. And we're going to debate
the big beautiful bill, which is going to add trillions to our national
debt. And it's a new era for Google as they released an AI first search
product. OpenAI has acquired Jony Ive's company IO to make some sort of
gadget. They've paid over \$6 billion. Is this the real deal or not?
You're going to find out today. And is energy the solution to every
problem we have? One bestie's got a very interesting take. All that and
more on the number one podcast in the world. Stick with us.

\[中文翻译\] 好了，各位。欢迎回到世界第一播客，All-In
播客。今天，原班人马回归。没有嘉宾，只有“全接触”Sachs
回来了。我们今天将深入探讨多个话题，包括债券市场的混乱，共和党人似乎已经放弃了
D.O.G.E.（政府效能部）议程。我们将辩论那项“宏伟壮丽的法案”，它将为我们的国债增加数万亿美元。谷歌发布了AI优先的搜索产品，标志着一个新时代的到来。OpenAI
收购了 Jony Ive 的公司
IO，据说是为了制造某种小工具，他们为此支付了超过60亿美元。这到底是真是假？今天你就会知道。能源是我们所有问题的解决方案吗？一位好兄弟对此有非常有趣的看法。所有这些以及更多精彩内容，尽在世界第一播客。请继续关注。

For the fourth year in a row, we're going to do the all-in summit. If
you guys remember four years ago, I decided, hey, let's do a summit. And
then these three besties were like, "No, we don't want to do a summit."
Now, it's become a big thing, and everybody loves it. September 7th to
9th in Los Angeles. I do give you credit for that, JCal. Yeah, after you
gave me hell for a year. Okay, that sounds like an apology, but okay,
sure. I'm sorry. You're wonderful, and I appreciate what you created.
Thank you very much. Wow, finally some credit. Okay, we all know the
goal of the summit is to have the world's most important conversations
and this year will be no different. yada yada yada allin.com/summit if
you would like to apply to come.

\[中文翻译\] 我们将连续第四年举办 All-In
峰会。如果你们还记得四年前，我决定，嘿，我们来办个峰会吧。然后这三位好兄弟都说：“不，我们不想办峰会。”现在，它已经成了一件大事，每个人都喜欢它。9月7日至9日在洛杉矶举行。JCal，我确实为此给你点赞。是啊，在你折磨了我一年之后。好吧，这听起来像个道歉，不过好吧，当然。对不起。你很棒，我感谢你创造的一切。非常感谢。哇，终于得到一些认可了。好吧，我们都知道峰会的目标是进行世界上最重要的对话，今年也不会例外。等等等等
allin.com/summit 如果你想申请参加的话。

Sacks:

Why do you say the most important conversations and then say yada yada
yada as a way to dismiss it? Do you think that that increases your
salesmanship and effectiveness?

\[中文翻译\]
你为什么说了最重要的对话之后，又用“等等等等”来敷衍它呢？你认为这能提高你的推销能力和效果吗？

JCal:

I don't want to make any grand pronouncements here, but these have been
important conversations we've had. It's been pretty great, I have to
say. yada yada yada. No, there's just like they put like 18 things in
the plugs now and I don't want to do too many.

\[中文翻译\]
我不想在这里发表任何宏大的声明，但我们确实进行过一些重要的对话。我得说，这相当不错。等等等等。不，只是他们现在在广告里放了大概18样东西，我不想做得太多。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

Why don't you do a modicum of work before you get on camera and actually
edit it. Here we go. I get one compliment and then that's exactly it. He
doesn't do the homework. So, he runs out of words. He's like, "We get
the biggest names to come to our summit. The vice president came. He
said yada yada yada." Elon Musk showed up in person. yada yada yada.
There was an astronaut. Freeberg lost his yada yada yada yada yada yada.

\[中文翻译\]
你为什么不在上镜前稍微做点功课，实际编辑一下呢？又来了。我刚得到一句赞扬，然后就原形毕露了。他不做功课。所以，他就词穷了。他会说：“我们请来了最大牌的人物参加我们的峰会。副总统来了。他又说等等等等。”伊隆·马斯克亲自到场。等等等等。还有个宇航员。Freeberg
也失去了他的等等等等。

JCal:

Uh, but this year will be no different. We'll have incredible parties,
blah blah blah, and let's get to work. Okay. President did a trip to the
Middle East, yada yada yada. Maybe more peace, a whole new framework.
America's going to yada yada yada yada yada. World's greatest moderator,
yada yada yada. Executive producer for life. Deal with it, Freeberg.
Okay. Uh, what's in the contract?

\[中文翻译\]
嗯，但今年也不会例外。我们将举办精彩的派对，等等等等，然后开始工作吧。好的。总统访问了中东，等等等等。也许会有更多和平，一个全新的框架。美国将会等等等等。世界上最伟大的主持人，等等等等。终身执行制片人。Freeberg，接受现实吧。好吧。呃，合同里有什么？



## 债券市场与“宏伟壮丽的法案”

<div class="dialogue">

JCal:

All right, let's get to work here. The bond market is the captain.
Apparently, Treasury Department sold \$16 billion worth of newly issued
20-year bonds on Wednesday afternoon, and there was weak demand. This
pushed yields higher across the board. The 10-year, which Freeberg has
said to focus on because it's the benchmark rate for most borrowing
costs, you know, mortgages and stuff like that. It spiked and here it
is. It actually hit a five handle at one point. A lot of people were
hand wringing about this. And the S&P dropped 1.5% in about 30 minutes.
Here's that chart as well. And the three major indices were all down
between 1.5 and 2% on the day. Obviously, in related news, the House
passed the big beautiful bill at the 11th hour last night. Uh this makes
the TCJA tax cuts permanent. Um and it's estimated to increase long-run
GDP by 60 basis points. Uh that's if all the cuts were implemented. It's
also going to reduce tax revenue by 4 trillion over 10 years is the
estimate and it's going to add between 3 and 5 trillion to the national
debt over 10 years. Freeberg. What's your take on the BBB and the weak
bond market, all of it?

\[中文翻译\]
好了，我们开始工作吧。债券市场是关键。显然，财政部周三下午出售了价值160亿美元新发行的20年期债券，但需求疲软。这全面推高了收益率。Freeberg
曾说过要关注10年期国债，因为它是大多数借贷成本的基准利率，比如抵押贷款之类的。它飙升了，就在这里。它一度触及5%的水平。很多人对此忧心忡忡。标普500指数在约30分钟内下跌了1.5%。这里也有那张图表。三大主要指数当天都下跌了1.5%到2%。显然，相关消息是，众议院昨晚在最后时刻通过了那项“宏伟壮丽的法案”。这将使TCJA（减税与就业法案）减税政策永久化。据估计，如果所有减税措施都得以实施，长期GDP将增加60个基点。据估计，这还将在10年内减少4万亿美元的税收，并将在10年内为国债增加3到5万亿美元。Freeberg，你对这个“宏伟壮丽的法案”（BBB）和疲软的债券市场有什么看法？

David Freeberg:

I just want to take a quick primer on how the government gets funded. I
know we we assume everyone understands it, but I think it's important
for folks to really grok it. For the federal government to make payments
to employees and contractors and buy stuff, they need to put money in
their bank accounts. And the way they put money in their bank accounts
is they issue bonds. These are treasury bonds. So they'll sell treasury
bonds to the public and individuals buy it, companies buy it, banks buy
it, and foreign governments buy US treasuries. And they transfer or wire
cash into the federal government's bank accounts, which they can then
use to pay for stuff. And then the Treasury Department needs to
continuously sell treasuries to raise cash to fund the government. When
folks don't show up to buy treasuries, that's a bad thing. And that
means that the government needs to increase the interest rate that
they're paying on those bonds. So what we saw on Wednesday was a really
weak demand signal for treasuries on this, you know, modest treasury
auction. Selling 16 billion of bonds is not a lot. There's hundreds of
billions being sold each quarter. And so this was not a big number, but
there was no buyer. The market was really dry. And so everyone that
participates in financial markets saw this and freaked out. And the big
motivation, the big understanding of the relationship here is to your
point that this big tax bill and spending bill is passing out of the
house. And that bill, as we talked about last week, has a high deficit
and that'll run up US debt over time, which makes it more difficult for
the US government to pay its bills because it has to issue more debt.
Interest payments have to be paid every year and so on. Now, if you just
pull up this one slide, this is something I thought was really worth
sharing. The CBO estimates, which is what you referenced, Jason, are
estimates of what the cost is going to be over time. And this is from
Jessica RLE or Ridle out of the Manhattan Institute put this chart
together. Congressional Budget Office. Yeah. So the Congressional Budget
Office, the CBO creates an estimate of the budget, the spending, and the
deficit, and ultimately the incremental debt that the US government will
need to issue to fund its obligations over time. This is a chart that
was put together that the expectation on a baseline basis is that over
the next 30 years or so, US debt to GDP will climb to 203%. But what a
lot of people don't know and don't talk about is that in the CBO
estimates, they assume in all of their models that interest rates are at
3.6%. And with the bond selloff yesterday, what we are now seeing is
30-year Treasury interest rates at over 5%. It's 5.1% this morning. And
for every incremental 1% above 3.6, you're spending an extra 350 billion
a year in interest. 350 billion a year. So, as we go up by 1.5% interest
over the next 10 years, we're spending another 5 trillion just on
interest payments. Half a trillion dollars a year of incremental
interest on the difference between 3.6 and 5.1. That's an incredible
recursive problem. And I say recursive because the incremental interest
that we now have to pay because interest rates just went up because the
market is demanding more payments from the government to fund this means
that the government has to issue more debt and it quickly gets away from
you. There is a nonlinear relationship between the deficit and interest
rates which drives up the debt problem in a nonlinear way and it gets
away from you and you can't fix it. And that's what the market is
telling us is that the current bill that's being passed out of the house
is showing such an extraordinarily high deficit that the market does not
want to buy the debt from the government. Rates are now climbing and
that creates a massive problem for the government.

\[中文翻译\]
我想先简单介绍一下政府是如何获得资金的。我知道我们假设每个人都明白，但我认为让大家真正理解这一点很重要。联邦政府要向雇员和承包商支付款项以及购买物品，他们需要在银行账户里有钱。而他们往银行账户里存钱的方式就是发行债券。这些是国债。他们会向公众出售国债，个人购买，公司购买，银行购买，外国政府也购买美国国债。他们将现金转账或电汇到联邦政府的银行账户，然后政府就可以用这些钱来支付开销。然后财政部需要不断出售国债来筹集现金以资助政府。当没有人来购买国债时，情况就很糟糕了。这意味着政府需要提高他们为这些债券支付的利率。所以我们周三看到的是，在这次规模不大的国债拍卖中，国债的需求信号非常疲软。出售160亿美元的债券并不算多。每个季度都有数千亿美元的债券被出售。所以这次数额不大，但没有买家。市场非常枯竭。因此，所有参与金融市场的人看到这个情况都吓坏了。这里的主要动机，或者说对这种关系的主要理解，正如你所说，是这项庞大的税收和支出法案正在众议院通过。正如我们上周讨论的，这项法案有很高的赤字，随着时间的推移，这将增加美国的债务，从而使美国政府更难偿还账单，因为它必须发行更多的债务。每年都必须支付利息等等。现在，如果你看一下这张幻灯片，这是我认为非常值得分享的内容。CBO（国会预算办公室）的估计，也就是你提到的，Jason，是对未来成本的估计。这是曼哈顿研究所的
Jessica RLE 或 Ridle
制作的图表。是的，国会预算办公室（CBO）会对预算、支出、赤字以及最终美国政府为履行其义务而需要发行的增量债务进行估计。这张图表显示，在基线情况下，预计未来30年左右，美国债务与GDP之比将攀升至203%。但许多人不知道也不谈论的是，在CBO的估计中，他们所有模型都假设利率为3.6%。而随着昨天的债券抛售，我们现在看到30年期国债利率超过了5%。今天早上是5.1%。每比3.6%高出1%，每年就要多支出3500亿美元的利息。每年3500亿美元。所以，随着未来10年利率上升1.5%，我们仅在利息支付上就要多支出5万亿美元。每年因3.6%和5.1%之间的差额而产生的增量利息就高达5000亿美元。这是一个难以置信的递归问题。我之所以说递归，是因为我们现在必须支付的增量利息——因为利率刚刚上升，因为市场要求政府支付更多资金来资助这一切——意味着政府必须发行更多债务，这很快就会失控。赤字和利率之间存在非线性关系，这会以非线性的方式加剧债务问题，使其失控且无法修复。这就是市场告诉我们的：目前正在众议院通过的法案显示出如此高的赤字，以至于市场不想购买政府的债务。利率正在攀升，这给政府带来了巨大的问题。

JCal:

Okay, Chamath, you've been tweeting about this. Uh we thought we were
going to get uh an administration and maybe um some focus from the
government that we would be have more austerity measures, balance the
budget. Now it looks like we're going to pour gasoline on the fire. What
are your thoughts?

\[中文翻译\]
好的，Chamath，你一直在推特上谈论这个。我们原以为会有一个政府，也许政府会关注一些事情，我们会采取更多紧缩措施，平衡预算。现在看来，我们反而是火上浇油。你有什么想法？

Chamath Palihapitiya:

I think we have to be careful here. So Jason, the political calculus
will be for the president to decide how much credit he actually wants to
take for this bill because even though it has his name on it, the
contents of the bill are different in actual facts than what I think he
intended. And what I mean by that is when you look inside of what
happened in the 11th hour last night, it's disappointing. This thing is
like anti-Doge. If Doge was meant to be a reflection of the American
voting population's desire for meaningful reform in government, cost
controls, some form of austerity, and to get this debt spiral in check.
This is the opposite of that. What happened was in the 11th hour, you
had a handful of people abstain. You had one person that passed away in
the last few days. You had one person that fell asleep on the floor of
the house, so he wasn't even woken up for the vote. And in the middle of
all of that chaos, what happened was all kinds of things were added and
attached and cancelled at the last minute because what happens is you
have to have these puts and takes as Freeberg described. If you want to
spend over here, you have to find a cut over there. But I think what
happened was there was really not a lot of financial literacy used to
decide what to actually put in and what to cut. And that lack of
discipline is going to create I think a negative set of consequences. So
what are those consequences? Today the tenure is around 4.5%. At the
rate in which it's escalating since liberation day, by the end of this
year, we're going to be past 5%. The 30 year is on a rate now to get
past 6 and a quarter, maybe even reach 6 1/2%. Those are way beyond what
most people thought was a reasonable place to be for the United States
economy. And so what will the implications be as rates go to those
levels? You'll delever from the United States. You'll sell US debt.
You'll own things like gold and Bitcoin. If you're curious about what's
happening to gold and Bitcoin, they started to spike in the last few
days. You'll have ratings organizations that add to this cascade by
downgrading the United States. That happened on Friday. You'll have very
smart people starting to signal that this is a much harder problem than
they initially thought. That's how I personally interpreted Elon's
comments over the last few days. So, what was the House supposed to do?
I think what they were supposed to do was implement some form of
austerity. They were supposed to by the will of the people pass a
recision bill. They were given that recision bill. It was just \$9
billion. They couldn't even pass a \$9 billion recision. And instead,
they passed a \$4 trillion inflation to our debt. Now, you hand this to
the Senate. The Senate is in a very difficult place as well. Do they
want to quote unquote claim victory and say, "Here you go, President
Trump. Here's your bill." But they'll further bastardize this thing and
it will be even further away from what I think benefits MAGA and
benefits Main Street. So who does it benefit? Current course and speed
right now. This bill is about traditional Republicans and traditional
Democrats circling the wagon and putting on a platter a set of things
that I think will be hurtful to average Americans. You're going to see
energy prices spike. You're gutting the number of electrons that will be
available for things like AI. You're going to increase Medicare prices
and the math is wrong. So when you sensitize this thing to a 4 and a
half or five or five and a quarter rate, so meaning not what the CBO
used but the real conditions on the ground, this thing is an albatross.
And I think unfortunately for President Trump's agenda and for a MAGA
movement, this is the worst of all conditions. The financial markets
will punish this. And then the last thing I'll say is now to top it all
off, I think that Jerome Powell will see the writing on the wall. Many
aspects of this thing are inflationary and if they're not handled well
by the Senate, he has a lot of room to actually increase interest rates.

\[中文翻译\]
我认为我们在这里必须小心。Jason，政治算计在于总统要决定他究竟想为这项法案争取多少功劳，因为即使法案上有他的名字，其实际内容与我认为他最初的意图有所不同。我的意思是，当你审视昨晚最后关头发生的事情时，会感到失望。这东西简直是反
D.O.G.E. 的。如果
D.O.G.E.（政府效能部）旨在反映美国选民对政府进行有意义改革、成本控制、某种形式的紧缩以及控制债务螺旋式上升的愿望，那么这个法案恰恰相反。发生的情况是，在最后关头，有少数人弃权。有一个人在过去几天去世了。有一个人在众议院的地板上睡着了，所以他甚至没有被叫醒投票。在所有这些混乱之中，各种各样的事情在最后一刻被添加、附加和取消，因为正如
Freeberg
所描述的，你必须有这些取舍。如果你想在这里花钱，就必须在那里找到削减开支的地方。但我认为发生的情况是，在决定实际投入什么和削减什么时，并没有运用太多的金融知识。这种缺乏纪律性我认为会造成一系列负面后果。那么这些后果是什么呢？今天10年期国债收益率在4.5%左右。自从“解放日”（可能指某个特定政策或事件的开始）以来，它一直在以这种速度攀升，到今年年底，我们将超过5%。30年期国债收益率目前正朝着超过6.25%，甚至可能达到6.5%的方向发展。这些水平远远超出了大多数人认为对美国经济而言合理的范围。那么，当利率达到这些水平时，会有什么影响呢？你会从美国去杠杆化。你会出售美国债务。你会持有黄金和比特币之类的东西。如果你好奇黄金和比特币发生了什么，它们在过去几天开始飙升。评级机构会通过下调美国评级来加剧这种连锁反应。这在周五发生了。一些非常聪明的人开始发出信号，表明这是一个比他们最初想象的要困难得多的问题。我个人就是这样解读伊隆·马斯克过去几天言论的。那么，众议院本该做什么呢？我认为他们本该实施某种形式的紧缩政策。他们本该顺应民意通过一项撤销法案。他们得到了那项撤销法案。那仅仅是90亿美元。他们甚至无法通过一项90亿美元的撤销法案。相反，他们通过了一项使我们债务膨胀4万亿美元的法案。现在，你把这个交给参议院。参议院也处境艰难。他们是否想“宣称胜利”并说：“特朗普总统，这是你的法案。”但他们会进一步糟蹋这个东西，它将更加偏离我认为对MAGA（让美国再次伟大）和普通民众有利的方向。那么它对谁有利呢？按照目前的情况和速度。这项法案是关于传统共和党人和传统民主党人抱团取暖，端上一盘我认为会对普通美国人造成伤害的东西。你会看到能源价格飙升。你正在削减可用于人工智能等领域的电力供应。你会提高医疗保险价格，而且计算是错误的。所以，当你将这个东西敏感化到4.5%、5%或5.25%的利率水平——也就是说，不是CBO使用的利率，而是实际情况下的利率——这个东西就是一个沉重的负担。而且我认为不幸的是，对于特朗普总统的议程和MAGA运动来说，这是最糟糕的情况。金融市场会惩罚这一点。最后我要说的是，现在雪上加霜的是，我认为杰罗姆·鲍威尔会看到不祥之兆。这个东西的许多方面都是通货膨胀性的，如果参议院处理不好，他有很大的空间来实际提高利率。

JCal:

Here's the uh prediction from Poly Market on what will happen to Fed
rate cuts in 2025. It's across the board. It seems like nobody can tell
if it's going to be zero, 1, 2, or three. 20 22 25 and 15% respectfully
respectively for those four options.

\[中文翻译\] 这是 Poly Market
对2025年美联储降息情况的预测。情况非常分散。似乎没有人能确定会是零次、一次、两次还是三次降息。这四个选项的概率分别是20%、22%、25%和15%。

David Sacks:

Sax, you don't speak for President Trump. You're the czar of AI and
crypto specifically. So, let's put that out there. But I'm curious your
thoughts on what happened with Doge. Why are we continuing to spend
ourselves into oblivion? And what will the downstream issues be here?
Because this sounds like it's going to be inflationary. This sounds like
it's going to be hard for people to buy homes. It's going to create more
austerity in the future. How bad is this? Do you feel it's as bad as
Dave and Chimath are framing it?

\[中文翻译\]
Sacks，你不代表特朗普总统发言。你是专门负责人工智能和加密货币的“沙皇”。所以，我们先明确这一点。但我很好奇你对
D.O.G.E.
事件的看法。为什么我们还在不断地花钱把自己推向深渊？这会带来哪些后续问题？因为这听起来会引发通货膨胀。这听起来会让人们难以购买房屋。这会在未来造成更多的紧缩。这到底有多糟糕？你觉得情况像
Freeberg 和 Chamath 描述的那么糟糕吗？

Well, look, I mean, I wish we had 435 members of the House who thought
like Freeberg about spending and deficits. Um, we don't. The Democrats
all want a lot more spending and a lot more taxes. Remember, if it
wasn't for Manchin-Sinema, we would have had that \$4.5 trillion build
back better. And among the Republicans in the House, unfortunately, we
have a bunch of Republicans who are pretty soft on spending. I mean, you
can call them rhinos if you want. And we only have what, like a three
vote margin in the House, and the Democrats are not cooperating in any
way. So, you don't have that many votes to spare. So, what I'm saying
here is you can't make the perfect the enemy of the good. I think you
have to be realistic about how much we can get done here. And I do think
that this bill does contain a lot of good things in it. There are a lot
of priorities for the administration in here. Do I wish it cut spending
more? Yes. I mean, do I wish that it made all the Doge cuts permanent
through recisions? Yeah, absolutely. I think it's outrageous that there
were enough House Republicans who didn't want to back up Doge that that
wasn't enacted. But there are a lot of good things in the bill and I
should just highlight them for balance here. So, the number one thing
here is that this bill will permanently extend the 2017 tax cuts. And if
we don't pass this bill, let's just assume that we do nothing. Okay, if
we do nothing, you're going to get the largest tax increase in decades,
and it won't just affect the rich. This affects the middle class as
well. The 2017 tax cuts increase the standard deduction, which is
important for the middle class. It raised the child tax credit. So
again, if you do nothing, you get a huge tax increase as soon as the
2017 tax cuts, which Trump passed back in his first term when they
sunset. So that's number one. In addition, there are promises here that
were made during the campaign to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime
that have been enacted, and the president promised to do those things,
and he is accomplishing those things. So I think that's important.
There's funding for the border wall here, 10,000 new ICE officers, more
detention beds, and so on. On energy, it repeals a methane tax and
unlocks new oil and gas on federal lands. And there's a bunch of other
things as well. So, there are a lot of good things in here. Now, to
Chamath's point, will this bill be bad for the Republicans prospects in
the midterms? I guess what I would say to that is I don't understand how
you expect to do well in midterms if Republicans preside over the
largest tax increase in decades. A tax increase that Joe Biden tried to
get during his administration. Biden tried to raise taxes and couldn't
get the votes for it. But if we don't make those tax cuts permanent, if
we allow the sunset to happen, then you will accomplish what Joe Biden
could not, which is to raise taxes on the American people. So, look, no
bill like this that's passed by a one vote margin on straight party
lines when you only have a three vote margin in the entire house is
going to satisfy everyone here.

\[中文翻译\] 嗯，你看，我的意思是，我希望众议院有435名成员都像 Freeberg
那样思考支出和赤字问题。嗯，我们没有。民主党人都想要更多的支出和更多的税收。记住，如果不是曼钦-西内玛（Manchin-Sinema），我们就会有那个4.5万亿美元的“重建美好未来”法案（Build
Back
Better）。不幸的是，在众议院的共和党人中，有一群在支出问题上相当软弱的共和党人。我的意思是，如果你愿意，可以称他们为“名义上的共和党人”（RINOs）。我们在众议院只有大约三票的多数，而民主党人根本不合作。所以，你没有那么多票可以浪费。所以，我想说的是，你不能让完美成为优秀的敌人。我认为你必须现实地看待我们在这里能完成多少事情。我确实认为这项法案包含了很多好的东西。这里面有很多政府的优先事项。我希望它能削减更多支出吗？是的。我的意思是，我希望它通过撤销法案使所有
D.O.G.E.
的削减永久化吗？是的，绝对如此。我认为有足够多的众议院共和党人不想支持
D.O.G.E.
以至于那没有被制定出来，这太离谱了。但法案中有很多好的东西，为了平衡起见，我应该在这里强调一下。所以，第一件事是，这项法案将永久延长2017年的减税政策。如果我们不通过这项法案，假设我们什么都不做。好吧，如果我们什么都不做，你将面临几十年来最大规模的增税，而且这不仅仅影响富人。这也影响中产阶级。2017年的减税政策增加了标准扣除额，这对中产阶级很重要。它提高了儿童税收抵免。所以再说一遍，如果你什么都不做，一旦2017年的减税政策（特朗普在他第一个任期内通过的）到期，你就会面临巨大的增税。这是第一点。此外，这里还有竞选期间做出的承诺，即取消小费和加班费的税收，这些已经制定了，总统承诺会做这些事情，而且他正在完成这些事情。所以我认为这很重要。这里有边境墙的资金，1万名新的ICE（移民与海关执法局）官员，更多的拘留床位等等。在能源方面，它废除了一项甲烷税，并在联邦土地上开放了新的石油和天然气。还有其他一些事情。所以，这里有很多好的东西。现在，关于
Chamath
的观点，这项法案会对共和党在中期选举的前景不利吗？我想对此说的是，我不明白如果共和党人主导了几十年来最大规模的增税，你怎么能期望在中期选举中表现良好。乔·拜登在他的政府期间试图推行的增税。拜登试图增税，但没有获得足够的选票。但是，如果我们不使那些减税政策永久化，如果我们允许它们到期，那么你将完成乔·拜登未能完成的事情，那就是对美国人民增税。所以，你看，像这样以一票优势、完全按党派路线通过的法案，而你在整个众议院只有三票的多数，是不可能让这里的每个人都满意的。

JCal:

Well, let me ask you a question there. You have Trump at his peak power.
You have all these threats of, hey, we're going to primary anybody if
they don't do like what we're saying here. Why isn't Trump just coming
in and using his power and just saying, hey, not good enough. Get back
to work. We need to cut spending. Period. Full stop. And he's got that
power. I don't hear him saying that.

\[中文翻译\]
好吧，让我问你一个问题。特朗普现在处于权力巅峰。你面临着各种威胁，比如，嘿，如果有人不按我们说的做，我们就会在初选中挑战他。为什么特朗普不直接介入，运用他的权力，就说，嘿，这不够好。回去工作。我们需要削减开支。就这样。句号。他有这个权力。我没听到他说这些。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

I do think that there are ways to enact the tax cuts and make them
permanent. And I think that that is a good part of what this bill did.
The problem was what happened from 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. And that's
all of the nonsense where I'll just be honest. I think the people in the
House are not nearly as financially literate as they need to be and I
think what they wanted to do was pass something and throw it over the
wall and say mission accomplished. Now it's up to the Senate and the
good news is look, the Senate has these six-year election cycles for a
reason. It allows them to think strategically and see past what's right
in front of them. So, I still think that there's a chance for the
president to have his cake and eat it, too. But I just want to highlight
that as a supporter of his and a supporter of that MAGA agenda, which I
think a lot of people voted for, I just want to be honest and say this
is not it. And there has to be some meaningful reforms in the Senate
version of this thing that gets sent back to the House. So, I'll give
you an example of one. 81% of the incremental energy that's generated in
the United States last year came from private enterprises that were
investing in short-term forms of power that have a credit and a transfer
market tied to it. This is just the financial machinery. This is how
Blackstone and Goldman Sachs and Brookfield and all of these big players
move tens and hundreds of billions of dollars around. They changed those
rules at the 11th hour. What is the impact of that? Elon foreshadowed
it. Nick, maybe you can show the headline of the article. He said, "We
could be running into a power capacity issue by mid next year." Now, if
we knew that, why would we take the short-term incentive away to
generate more electrons? All the great things that David has done, that
the president has done on AI, I mean, we'll talk about what happened in
the Middle East. But when the rubber meets the road and you actually
have a shortage of electrons because these financial actors, they're
not, you know, and in fairness to them, they're acting rationally. You
take the financial incentive away and you can't underwrite this thing.
What are they going to do? They're just going to stop doing it. So in
the absence of electrons, what happens? Prices go up. It's inflationary.
And now you'll have to allocate electrons. Does the electrons go to an
AI data center or does it go to a home? In a different example, actually
on the residential side, places like Florida, I think there was like an
incentive for like batteries. So if you are about to get hit by a
hurricane, you can buy these big battery systems from Tesla as an
example, but there are other ones, Generac and whatever company that was
cut out. And so in Texas, all of these impacts will have negative
consequences. My point is, I think you have to really look at what
happened in the 11th hour and fix those things because the problem with
these plans is you can't look at gains that are in years 6 through 10 to
justify pain in years 1 through 5. You can't do that. Because I
understand how that mathematically makes sense. It doesn't make sense
practically for the average American. That's just not how life works.
You don't go into a J curve. You know, we do that as investors, right?
But you don't do that as a normal American, which is be on the wrong
side of the economy for four or five years in the hopes that your six
and seven are good. That's the point that has to get fixed.

\[中文翻译\]
我确实认为有办法实施减税并使其永久化。我认为这是该法案做得好的一个方面。问题在于晚上11点到早上6点之间发生的事情。坦白说，那全是胡闹。我认为众议院的人金融素养远未达到应有的水平，而且我认为他们想做的就是通过一些东西，然后把它扔到一边，宣布任务完成。现在轮到参议院了，好消息是，参议院有这些为期六年的选举周期是有原因的。这让他们能够进行战略性思考，看得更远，而不仅仅是眼前的事情。所以，我仍然认为总统有机会鱼与熊掌兼得。但我只想强调，作为他的支持者和MAGA议程的支持者——我认为很多人都投票支持了这个议程——我只想坦诚地说，这不是我们想要的。参议院版本的法案在送回众议院之前，必须进行一些有意义的改革。我给你举个例子。去年美国产生的增量能源中，81%
来自私人企业，这些企业投资于短期形式的电力，并与信贷和转让市场挂钩。这只是金融机器。这就是黑石、高盛、布鲁克菲尔德以及所有这些大玩家调动数百亿甚至数千亿美元资金的方式。他们在最后一刻改变了这些规则。这有什么影响？伊隆预示了这一点。Nick，也许你可以展示一下文章的标题。他说：“到明年年中，我们可能会遇到电力容量问题。”现在，如果我们知道这一点，为什么还要取消产生更多电力的短期激励措施呢？所有
David
所做的伟大的事情，总统在人工智能方面所做的伟大的事情，我的意思是，我们将讨论中东发生的事情。但当真正付诸实践时，你实际上会遇到电力短缺，因为这些金融参与者，他们并非……你知道，公平地说，他们是在理性行事。你取消了金融激励，你就无法为这件事提供资金。他们会怎么做？他们只会停止这样做。那么在没有电力的情况下会发生什么？价格上涨。这是通货膨胀。现在你将不得不分配电力。电力是流向人工智能数据中心还是流向家庭？再举一个不同的例子，实际上在住宅方面，像佛罗里达这样的地方，我认为曾经有过类似电池的激励措施。所以如果你即将遭遇飓风，你可以购买像特斯拉这样的大型电池系统，但也有其他公司的，比如
Generac
和其他一些被取消的公司。所以在德克萨斯州，所有这些影响都会产生负面后果。我的观点是，我认为你必须真正审视在最后一刻发生的事情并加以修正，因为这些计划的问题在于，你不能用第6到10年的收益来证明第1到5年的痛苦是合理的。你不能这样做。因为我明白这在数学上是说得通的。但对于普通美国人来说，这在实践中是行不通的。生活不是这样的。你不会经历一个J型曲线。你知道，我们作为投资者会这样做，对吧？但作为一个普通美国人，你不会这样做，也就是在经济的错误一方待上四五年，指望着第六年和第七年能好起来。这一点必须得到修正。

JCal:

I asked Chamath the question, shouldn't Trump use his capital he's built
up here and say not good enough, make some cuts here? What would you say
to President Trump if he was asking you for your advice? Freeberg.

\[中文翻译\] 我问了 Chamath
这个问题，特朗普难道不应该利用他在这里积累的资本，说这不够好，在这里做些削减吗？如果特朗普总统向你征求意见，你会对他说什么？Freeberg。

David Freeberg:

I think the writing's on the wall that the system is winning and the
rebels came in and they tried to fix the inefficiencies in government
with Doge under Elon's leadership and our friend Antonio's participation
and a great group of individuals who are true patriots who are spending
time trying to help reassess how the government operates. And they, as
I've said from day one, for my first visit to DC during inauguration
weekend and every visit I've done since then, I always leave after
meeting with members of Congress deeply worried that they won't actually
do what they need to do to make the changes. And the last line of
defense ultimately is the president with his veto authority and his
ability to tell people to go back, rethink this, and cut spending. I
feel like we're in a last ditch effort. And I'll tell you why I say it's
last ditch. I think that there's a relationship between what's going on
in the United States and what's going on in Japan. Nick, if you'll pull
up the Japanese government 40-year bond yield chart. So, just so you
guys can kind of observe, in the last couple of days, we've seen
Japanese bond yields soar from 2.5% to 3.5%. Remember, Japan owns \$1.1
trillion of US treasuries. I'll just read a quote from a guy uh who's
the chief global strategist named Albert Edwards at Société Générale and
he said recent developments in Japan may signal the end of the favorable
investment cycle that's been established since the 2008 global financial
crisis potentially reshaping global financial landscapes in the coming
months.

\[中文翻译\]
我认为不祥之兆已经显现，体制正在获胜，而反叛者们进来了，他们试图在伊隆的领导下，在我们的朋友安东尼奥的参与下，以及一群真正的爱国者——他们花时间帮助重新评估政府运作方式——的努力下，通过
D.O.G.E.
来修复政府的低效问题。正如我从第一天起，从我就职典礼周末第一次访问华盛顿特区以及此后的每一次访问中所说的那样，每次与国会议员会面后，我总是深感担忧，担心他们实际上不会做他们需要做的事情来进行变革。最终的最后一道防线是总统，他拥有否决权，并且有能力告诉人们回去，重新考虑这个问题，并削减开支。我觉得我们正在做最后的努力。我会告诉你为什么我说这是最后的努力。我认为美国正在发生的事情和日本正在发生的事情之间存在联系。Nick，如果你能调出日本政府40年期债券收益率图表。所以，只是为了让你们可以观察一下，在过去几天里，我们看到日本债券收益率从2.5%飙升至3.5%。记住，日本持有1.1万亿美元的美国国债。我来读一段法国兴业银行（Société
Générale）首席全球策略师阿尔伯特·爱德华兹（Albert
Edwards）的话，他说：“日本最近的发展可能预示着自2008年全球金融危机以来建立的有利投资周期的结束，这可能在未来几个月重塑全球金融格局。”

Chamath Palihapitiya:

Can I translate that because it's it's incredibly important what
Freeberg said but I'll translate that what he is saying. So this is a
guy from SocGen since 2007-2008. Every now and then the markets give you
free money. One of the most obvious free money trades was the yen carry
trade. And in order to to execute that trade, you're effectively
leveraging treasuries against the Japanese bond market. What he is
saying is that there is increasing risk that that trade unwinds. When
that trade unwinds, what you're going to have are net sellers of up to,
as Freeberg said, a trillion plus dollars of US treasuries. What will
that do? It will further exacerbate the market's reluctance to own US
treasuries, which means yields go even higher, which means interest
rates for businesses and individuals go higher. Correct. And the only
way to keep those interest rates low will be for the Federal Reserve to
try and step in and buy those bonds, which will devalue the dollar. And
in his commentary, he went on to say that uh the 20-year Japanese bond
auction that just took place, similar to the US Treasury auction that
just took place, was the worst they've seen since 1987. That's how
significant this event was in Japan over the past week. So the massive
climb in bond yields in Japan indicates a massive selloff in credit. And
remember if you look at the historical perspective when the global
reserve currency nation sees their debt sell off it usually is part of a
global selloff that happens. It's not just the US that gets affected.
And any one of these markets can cause a cataclysmic follow on to the
rest of the global financial markets. like if Japan sells off too much,
we are going to start to see a lot of unraveling happening. That's the
consequence I think of this particular bill because it's it signals a
lack of a reluctance to actually address.

\[中文翻译\] 我能翻译一下吗？因为 Freeberg
说的话非常重要，但我会翻译一下他正在说的内容。所以这是一个来自法国兴业银行（SocGen）的人，自2007-2008年以来。市场时不时会给你白送钱。最明显的白送钱交易之一就是日元套利交易。为了执行这种交易，你实际上是在利用美国国债与日本债券市场进行杠杆操作。他所说的是，这种交易平仓的风险越来越大。当这种交易平仓时，正如
Freeberg所说，你将会看到高达一万多亿美元的美国国债净卖家。这会带来什么后果？这将进一步加剧市场不愿持有美国国债的情绪，这意味着收益率会更高，从而导致企业和个人的利率上升。没错。而保持这些利率低水平的唯一方法就是美联储介入并购买这些债券，但这会导致美元贬值。在他的评论中，他接着说，刚刚进行的20年期日本债券拍卖，与刚刚进行的美国国债拍卖类似，是自1987年以来他们见过的最糟糕的一次。这就是过去一周日本发生的这件事的重要性所在。因此，日本债券收益率的大幅攀升表明信贷市场出现了大规模抛售。记住，如果你从历史角度看，当全球储备货币国家的债务被抛售时，通常是全球抛售的一部分。不仅仅是美国受到影响。这些市场中的任何一个都可能对全球其他金融市场造成灾难性的连锁反应。比如，如果日本抛售过多，我们将会开始看到很多问题暴露出来。我认为这就是这项特定法案的后果，因为它表明了（政府）不愿意真正解决问题。

JCal:

Let me let me say something here. I called Freeberg today on the way
here. It's very rare that he and I agree about this kind of stuff
because normally what I say is you're catastrophizing. Sure, calm down.
But this is where I will say I'll put my money where my mouth is and
I'll put the chips on the table to say this is the moment. This is the
moment where we either reunderwrite what we voted for or we mistakenly
pass this Christmas tree concoction. It does have President Trump's
signature on the top of it. It does have some features that he asked
for, but what I hope he sees and realizes is the details here matter.
And without some technical maneuvering in the Senate, this is a bad bill
as constructed. And if it passes, forget what any of us think, the bond
markets will act decisively and they are going to go in one direction
and it's away from us. And I just hope that we figure this out. Seems
like a classic diffusion of responsibility here, Sacks. You have
Congress, Senate, and POTUS not willing to step up and say, "Let's cut
the spending."

\[中文翻译\] 让我在这里说几句。我今天在来的路上给 Freeberg
打了电话。我和他很少在这种事情上达成一致，因为通常我会说他是在危言耸听。当然，冷静点。但在这个问题上，我会说我言出必行，我会把筹码放到桌面上说，就是现在了。现在是我们要么重新审视我们投票支持的东西，要么错误地通过这个像圣诞树一样堆砌起来的法案。法案上面确实有特朗普总统的签名。它确实有一些他要求的功能，但我希望他看到并意识到的是，这里的细节很重要。如果在参议院没有一些技术性的操作，这个法案就其目前的结构而言是个糟糕的法案。如果它通过了，别管我们任何人怎么想，债券市场会果断行动，它们会朝着一个方向发展，那就是远离我们。我只希望我们能解决这个问题。Sacks，这看起来像是典型的责任分散。国会、参议院和总统都不愿意站出来说：“让我们削减开支。”

David Sacks:

Well, I don't I don't think that's fair. I mean, look, the president
backed up Elon and Doge. First of all, he created Doge. He gave it the
US digital service. He backed it up in every cabinet meeting, in every
public pronouncement. There's a limit though to what he can do. Congress
has the power of the purse. And we said on a previous episode that at
the end of the day, for the Doge cuts to become permanent, Congress has
to incorporate that into the budget. And the reality is there are still
a number of these like old bull appropriators on the Republican side who
just are not wired to make spending cuts.

\[中文翻译\] 嗯，我不认为这公平。我的意思是，你看，总统支持了伊隆和
D.O.G.E.。首先，他创建了
D.O.G.E.。他赋予了它美国数字服务的地位。他在每一次内阁会议、每一次公开声明中都支持它。但他能做的事情是有限度的。国会掌握着财政大权。我们在之前的一期节目中说过，归根结底，要使
D.O.G.E.
的削减永久化，国会必须将其纳入预算。而现实是，共和党方面仍然有一些像老派的拨款者，他们根本不习惯削减开支。

JCal:

Why are we hearing him vocally saying stop this madness? He is the most
vocal guy in the world who mixes it up every topic on the planet. Why
is...

\[中文翻译\]
为什么我们听到他大声疾呼停止这种疯狂？他是世界上最敢言的人，对地球上所有话题都能发表意见。为什么...

David Sacks:

Let's give him the benefit of the doubt. Let's give him the benefit of
the doubt. He's probably working it all in the back channel. There are
the things that he wants and he's in the midst of negotiating as well.
But my my point is just this. The level of financial illiteracy in this
bill will come back to bite America in the ass.

\[中文翻译\]
让我们姑且相信他。让我们姑且相信他。他可能正在幕后运作这一切。有些事情是他想要的，他也正在谈判之中。但我的观点就是这个。这项法案中体现出的金融素养之低，最终会让美国自食其果。

JCal:

Look, here here's the problem is that what what you guys want to sell
right now is austerity. And the reality is that the politicians in
Washington just are not buying austerity right now. I mean, that's what
you want is austerity. Yep. And the reality is the only way you get true
austerity, like a painful set of changes, is when both parties link arms
and jump off the cliff together and and make those changes. The
Democrats right now have no willingness to do that. They're opposed to
doing this. This is a straight line party reconciliation vote. I think
you're trying to overload this vote with way too much stuff. You're
trying to basically say that this vote has to fix America's fiscal
problems. Just not going to happen. I mean, I look, I agree with you
that the fiscal situation needs to get fixed. This is just not the vote
where it's going to happen. You cannot exacerbate it.

\[中文翻译\]
你看，问题在于，你们现在想推销的是紧缩政策。而现实是，华盛顿的政客们现在根本不买紧缩政策的账。我的意思是，你们想要的就是紧缩。是的。而现实是，要实现真正的紧缩，比如一系列痛苦的变革，唯一的办法就是两党携手，一起跳下悬崖，共同做出这些改变。民主党人现在根本没有意愿这样做。他们反对这样做。这是一个纯粹的党派和解投票。我认为你们试图给这次投票附加太多东西了。你们基本上是想说这次投票必须解决美国的财政问题。这是不可能发生的。我的意思是，你看，我同意你们的看法，财政状况需要得到解决。但这绝不是通过这次投票就能实现的。你们不能加剧这个问题。

David Sacks:

Well, I don't know. I mean, look, I understand that this doesn't have as
much stuff as as we want. I mean, like I said, I want to see the Doge
cuts made permanent, but the alternative to this bill, let's say the
alternative is just do nothing. That is actually meaningfully worse
because you will get a massive tax increase. Massive. I think President
Trump inherited a Biden economy that was already feeling pretty shaky. I
don't know what the argument is for a massive tax increase in an economy
that's not doing great. I'd rather see the tax cuts made permanent. I'd
rather see the no tax on tips and overtime implemented. Important
campaign promises. I'd rather see funding for the border wall. I mean,
these are all important things that we need to have happen. And I just
don't think that this bill is how you're going to start.

\[中文翻译\]
嗯，我不知道。我的意思是，你看，我明白这个法案没有包含我们想要的那么多内容。我的意思是，就像我说的，我希望看到
D.O.G.E.
的削减永久化，但这个法案的替代方案，假设替代方案就是什么都不做。那实际上会更糟糕，因为你会面临大规模的增税。大规模的。我认为特朗普总统继承了一个已经感觉相当不稳的拜登经济。我不知道在一个经济状况不佳的情况下，大规模增税的理由是什么。我宁愿看到减税永久化。我宁愿看到取消小费和加班费税收的政策得到实施。这些是重要的竞选承诺。我宁愿看到边境墙获得资金。我的意思是，这些都是我们需要发生的重要事情。我只是不认为这个法案是你开始的方式。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

Good. But what I'm saying is why do you pay for that with electron
supply for homes and AI? I don't know. I mean, you're talking about a
pretty esoteric issue, Chamath. This is not the same as solving the US
budget situation. Why do it by doing Medicaid cuts? Why?

\[中文翻译\]
好的。但我想说的是，你为什么要用家庭和人工智能的电力供应来为此买单呢？我不知道。我的意思是，Chamath，你谈论的是一个相当深奥的问题。这和解决美国预算状况不是一回事。为什么要通过削减医疗补助（Medicaid）来实现呢？为什么？

David Sacks:

Well, let's talk about the Medicaid cuts first of all. I mean, you're
being a little bit schizophrenic about this. I mean, you guys are saying
that you want to see more cuts, but then you also believe that the
Medicaid cuts are a bad idea. So, you got to kind of choose.

\[中文翻译\]
好吧，首先我们来谈谈医疗补助（Medicaid）的削减。我的意思是，你在这方面有点精神分裂。我的意思是，你们说希望看到更多的削减，但你们又认为削减医疗补助是个坏主意。所以，你们得做出选择。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

I'm not saying that. I think all cuts are great. Cuts across the board.
Yeah, cuts across the board. Spread it out.

\[中文翻译\]
我不是那么说的。我认为所有削减都是好的。全面削减。是的，全面削减。分散开来。

David Sacks:

You got to decide what you're opposed to. Are you opposed to cuts or you
want more of them?

\[中文翻译\] 你得决定你反对什么。你是反对削减还是想要更多削减？

Chamath Palihapitiya:

I want more cuts. And given the fiscal situation, I'm actually if if
someone showed up and said, "Hey, we're going to increase taxes." I'd
say, "That's what we got to do right now. Everyone's got to take a hit
on this." But hey, I know I'm going to be alone in that. So, I'm not
going to try and make that argument.

\[中文翻译\]
我想要更多削减。考虑到财政状况，如果有人出现说：“嘿，我们要增加税收。”我会说：“这就是我们现在必须做的。每个人都得为此承担一些损失。”但是，嘿，我知道在这方面我会是孤军奋战。所以，我不会试图去争论这一点。

David Sacks:

I guess the question for you, you're not alone in that. I agree with
you. Well, let me ask a question, Sacks. What do you think is the moment
when the two parties lock arms and do jump together? What is the
conditions that need to be kind of prevalent for us to take, you know,
draconian austerity measures?

\[中文翻译\]
我想问你的问题是，你在这方面并不孤单。我同意你的看法。好吧，让我问一个问题，Sacks。你认为两党会在什么时候携手并肩，共同行动？需要什么样的普遍条件，我们才能采取，你知道，严厉的紧缩措施？

David Freeberg:

Probably the bond market forces it on the politicians force it on
Washington.

\[中文翻译\] 可能是债券市场迫使政客们，迫使华盛顿这样做。

Sacks:

Yeah, I think you're right. You're an economist by background. Do you
see that happening right now? Like do you see this the sell-off that's
happening not just in the US, but everyone that's linked to the US with
Japan and so on. Don't you think that the markets telling us that this
might be the moment?

\[中文翻译\]
是的，我想你是对的。你是有经济学背景的。你认为现在正在发生这种情况吗？比如你是否看到不仅仅在美国，而且在所有与美国相关的国家，比如日本等等，都在发生抛售。难道你不认为市场在告诉我们这可能就是那个时刻吗？

David Freeberg:

It could be the moment, but you know, I remember the first week of April
when Larry Summers came on the pod and said that the markets were
melting down and that was a different moment that he was trying to sell
in favor of his policy. So my point is just there's market volatility
and we won't know for a while whether this means anything. It could just
be a blip, right? So look, you ask me what are the conditions for
getting austerity. I think that austerity will have to be imposed on
Washington from the outside. Washington's not going to find the will
internally. We had a wonderful moment here where you have Elon come in
with Doge, which the president made possible. Okay. No other president
would have even have done this. Agreed. Agreed. Big credit for that.
Where you get a total outsider to come in and bring a team of like young
big bald geniuses and you let them go through these departments line by
line and start deleting things. Okay. And they made I think great
progress. I think they found a 160 billion a year of cuts that can be
made administratively. Beyond that they need Congress to approve it. And
I will acknowledge that there are still a number of soft onspending
Rhino Republicans and there's just not a majority for the types of
austerity and cuts that you guys would like to see. I mean, that's just
the reality. Yeah. But I still think that the question with this bill is
just how pure you want to be. My point is just are you going to make the
perfect the enemy of the good? I don't think you're going to get
austerity out of Washington right now. It's just not in the cards. The
question is whether this bill is basically better than the status quo.
And I and I think it is because of the tax cuts.

\[中文翻译\]
这可能是那个时刻，但是你知道，我记得四月的第一周，拉里·萨默斯来到播客上说市场正在崩溃，那是他试图为了推销他的政策而营造的另一个时刻。所以我的观点是，市场存在波动性，我们暂时不会知道这是否意味着什么。这可能只是一个小插曲，对吧？所以你看，你问我实现紧缩的条件是什么。我认为紧缩必须从外部强加给华盛顿。华盛顿内部不会找到这种意愿。我们这里曾有过一个绝佳的时刻，伊隆带着
D.O.G.E.
进来了，这是总统促成的。好的。没有其他总统会这样做。同意。同意。为此要大大赞扬。你让一个完全的局外人进来，带来一个由年轻、聪明、光头的“天才”组成的团队，你让他们逐条审查这些部门并开始删除东西。好的。我认为他们取得了巨大进展。我认为他们找到了每年可以行政削减的1600亿美元。除此之外，他们需要国会批准。我承认，仍然有一些在支出问题上软弱的“名义上的共和党人”（Rhino
Republicans），而且对于你们希望看到的那种紧缩和削减，根本没有多数支持。我的意思是，这就是现实。是的。但我仍然认为，关于这项法案的问题在于你到底想做到多纯粹。我的观点是，你是否会因为追求完美而放弃好的东西？我不认为你现在能从华盛顿得到紧缩政策。这根本不可能。问题在于这项法案基本上是否比现状更好。而且我认为是的，因为减税。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

To your point, without opining on it, I think what's going to happen is
the bond market will sensitize this budget at real rates. They're not
going to use the 3.6 that Freeberg pointed to. They're just going to
rewrite this at 5, five and a quarter, or 5 1/2. That has a very
different risk exposure, I think. And so to your point, they'll react.
If it looks like it passes as is, then that's what they'll do. And to
your point, David, we'll know in the next 60 to 90 days. Let's say that
this is just a blip in the market and it's not some larger once in a
century type event. The reality is we don't know exactly what's going to
happen.

\[中文翻译\]
关于你的观点，我不加评论，但我认为将会发生的是债券市场会以实际利率来敏感化这个预算。他们不会使用
Freeberg
指出的3.6%的利率。他们只会以5%、5.25%或5.5%的利率重新计算。我认为这会带来非常不同的风险敞口。所以，正如你所说，他们会做出反应。如果看起来法案会按原样通过，那么他们就会这样做。而且，David，正如你所说，我们会在未来60到90天内知道结果。假设这只是市场的一个小波动，而不是什么百年一遇的大事件。现实是我们并不确切知道会发生什么。

Sacks:

Look, I don't like America's fiscal picture at all. But what if the AI
and robotics revolution plays out in the most optimistic way over the
next decade and is massively deflationary and we get basically AI
powered robots expanding the economy massively. You need power for that.
I get that and we need to do power generation for sure. But my point is
just what if the new technology provides an answer to the fiscal
situation that's not currently on the table. I think again. So, this is
my point is is Washington's not going to embrace...

\[中文翻译\]
看，我一点也不喜欢美国的财政状况。但是，如果人工智能和机器人革命在未来十年以最乐观的方式发展，并带来大规模的通货紧缩，我们基本上会看到人工智能驱动的机器人极大地扩展经济。你需要为此提供电力。我明白这一点，我们确实需要进行发电。但我的观点是，如果新技术为目前尚未考虑到的财政状况提供了答案呢？我再想想。所以，我的观点是，华盛顿不会接受……

Chamath Palihapitiya:

I understand, but you're going to have brownouts and blackouts of
average human homes to do that.

\[中文翻译\] 我明白，但要做到这一点，普通家庭将会面临限电和停电。

Sacks:

No, you shouldn't have to make these decisions. Those are dumb
trade-offs. You're not going to be able to solve the power generation
problem in a reconciliation bill.

\[中文翻译\]
不，你不应该被迫做出这些决定。那些是愚蠢的权衡。你不可能通过一项和解法案来解决发电问题。

JCal:

And I want to just add my two cents at the end here. Leadership starts
at the top. This president acts unilaterally all the time. Whether it's
immigration, DEI, he has no problem. And this is what he is doing. He's
endorsing this bill. He's saying it's big. It's beautiful. He is saying
this is historic. I think this is bad leadership. I'll just say it
straight out. He was elected to balance this budget and to have
austerity. He's going to put more onto the debt. And we sat here on this
very podcast, the four of us, and said this was the most important issue
on the world. And Trump is putting gasoline on the fire. I think it's
bad leadership. Let's continue on the docket.

\[中文翻译\]
最后我想补充一点我的看法。领导力始于高层。这位总统总是单方面行动。无论是移民问题还是DEI（多元化、公平和包容性）问题，他都没有问题。他现在就在这么做。他支持这项法案。他说这很宏大。很美好。他说这是历史性的。我认为这是糟糕的领导力。我就直说了。他当选是为了平衡预算和实行紧缩政策。他却要增加债务。我们四个人曾在这个播客上说过，这是世界上最重要的问题。而特朗普却在火上浇油。我认为这是糟糕的领导力。我们继续讨论议程。

Sacks:

I suggest you look at the Constitution because the power of the purse
rests with Congress. He's endorsing this. He's endorsing it. He's not
even putting up a fight. When it comes to immigration, these other
areas, the president has far more unilateral power and he's used that
every chance he gets. But when it comes to spending, you have to get
Congress on board. This is a bill that passed with a one vote margin. I
don't know where you think the opportunity is to squeeze out more
concessions from Congress. I don't think he could speak up. He could
speak up and say do better. He's doing the opposite. He's doing the
opposite. This bill passed by a one vote margin. It was hanging on by a
thread. And if it failed, you get basically hundreds of billions of tax
increases, which we don't need right now. And you know, in terms of in
terms of I think he's trying in terms of Republican prospects. Look,
people vote for Republicans to do two things. Cut taxes and cut
spending. I wish that this bill did two out of two. It does one out of
two with some of the second one like with the Medicaid stuff. If we
didn't at least cut taxes, there'd be no reason to vote for Republicans.
None.

\[中文翻译\]
我建议你看看宪法，因为财政大权在国会手中。他支持这个法案。他支持它。他甚至没有进行任何斗争。在移民等其他领域，总统拥有更大的单方面权力，他抓住了每一个机会使用这种权力。但涉及到支出问题，你必须得到国会的支持。这项法案是以一票的微弱优势通过的。我不知道你认为从哪里可以从国会那里争取到更多让步。我不认为他能发声。他本可以发声并要求做得更好。他却在做相反的事情。他正在做相反的事情。这项法案以一票的优势通过。它岌岌可危。如果它失败了，你基本上会面临数千亿美元的增税，这是我们现在不需要的。而且你知道，就我认为他正在努力争取共和党的前景而言。你看，人们投票给共和党是为了做两件事：减税和削减开支。我希望这项法案能做到这两点。它做到了其中一点，另一点做到了一部分，比如医疗补助方面的内容。如果我们至少不减税，那就没有理由投票给共和党了。一点理由都没有。

JCal:

You all are much closer to him than I am. You all should be challenging
him to not endorse this and to do the opposite. That would be the
profile and courage.

\[中文翻译\]
你们都比我更接近他。你们都应该挑战他，让他不要支持这个法案，而是做相反的事情。那才是有担当和勇气的表现。

Sacks:

Then we get the biggest increase in decades. Great. No, he should just
go to everybody and say do better.

\[中文翻译\]
那我们就会面临几十年来最大幅度的增长。太棒了。不，他应该直接去找每个人，让他们做得更好。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

I don't agree with that tactic. I think the better tactic is to do what
he did, but then work behind the scenes and help the Senate implement
the technical guard rails that make the bill better than it as is. Look,
nobody thinks that this bill is going to pass as is. It's going to go
through its own set of changes in the Senate. Now, I think the
opportunity is to understand these puts and takes with a little bit more
detail and a little bit more mathematical precision and fix it. So, I
still hold out hope that we're going to get to a better place. But he's
going to have much more influence, Jason, by actually taking the
positive path than throwing everybody under the bus. The real question
will be in 30 days or 45 days, what is the final version of this thing?
And whatever gets passed and signed by him, there will have been enough
time to understand it. And you'll see the real-time reactions. All I'm
trying to indicate is I think that this was a moment where people were
very pensively optimistic that the approach of Doge would really be
embraced and that we'd see some broadscale attempts to at least and you
know Freeberg said this just to go back to 2019 even if we don't do
anything else just go back to 2019 pretend COVID didn't happen. Yeah.
And we would be, by the way, if we did that, we would have a budget
surplus and the bonds would be trading down to 2% yields again. I mean,
we would be in such an incredible condition. We've got 2% inflation
right now.

\[中文翻译\]
我不同意那种策略。我认为更好的策略是做他所做的事情，然后在幕后工作，帮助参议院实施技术性的保障措施，使法案比现在更好。你看，没有人认为这个法案会按原样通过。它将在参议院经历一系列修改。现在，我认为机会在于更详细、更精确地理解这些取舍并加以修正。所以，我仍然抱有希望，我们会达到一个更好的境地。但是，Jason，他通过采取积极的方式会比把所有人都推下水有更大的影响力。真正的问题是，在30天或45天后，这个东西的最终版本是什么？无论通过并由他签署的是什么，都会有足够的时间去理解它。你会看到实时的反应。我只是想表明，我认为这是一个人们非常审慎乐观的时刻，认为
D.O.G.E. 的方法会真正被接受，我们会看到一些大规模的尝试，至少——你知道
Freeberg说过这个——即使我们什么都不做，仅仅回到2019年，假装新冠疫情没有发生。是的。顺便说一句，如果我们那样做了，我们就会有预算盈余，债券收益率会再次降至2%。我的意思是，我们将会处于一种难以置信的良好状况。我们现在的通货膨胀率是2%。

JCal:

Anyway, we don't need to beat the dead horse. Let's move on. I wish I
wish there were 218 members of the House who thought like I hear you. Oh
gosh. Listen, this guy is saying he's going to primary anybody who, you
know, doesn't he should be speaking up right now. I'll tell you what,
give him the line item veto and then let's talk, right? How about you
saying guys spend less money? He doesn't have to throw him under the
bus, Chamath. It could be something very subtle. But you make it that
way. What you the way that you position it is like you make it such a
black and white thing and it's I speak up is is black and white. He's
there's a lot going on bill.

\[中文翻译\]
总之，我们不需要再纠缠这个问题了。让我们继续。我希望众议院有218名成员的想法和你们一样。哦天哪。听着，这家伙说他会在初选中挑战任何……你知道，不……他现在就应该大声疾呼。我告诉你，给他单项否决权，然后我们再谈，对吧？你说让大家少花点钱怎么样？Chamath，他不必把他们推下水。这可以是非常微妙的。但你却把它弄成那样。你把它定位的方式，就像你把它变成了一个非黑即白的事情，而我说出来就是非黑即白。这个法案牵扯的事情很多。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

No, but what I'm saying is he is I'm guessing I don't know, but I'm
going to assume working behind the scenes. And what you're saying is he
should virtue signal and prognosticate in public. And I'm saying that I
I never said virtue signal. That's what you're asking him to do. No, I'm
not. I'm asking him to say reduce spending in the bill because that's
good for America.

\[中文翻译\]
不，但我的意思是，我猜——我不知道，但我会假设他正在幕后工作。而你所说的是他应该在公开场合进行道德表演和预测。而我说的是我——我从没说过道德表演。你是在要求他那么做。不，我没有。我是在要求他说在法案中减少开支，因为这对美国有好处。

David Sacks:

This bill cuts 880 billion for Medicaid over a decade, which is
something that already is politically tough and controversial. It
imposes work requirements for able-bodied adults. This is similar to
what Bill Clinton did back in 1996 with welfare reform. Basically saying
that you can't be a layabout and get welfare. So these are relatively
tough things to do politically. It's like do I want to see even more
cuts? Yeah, absolutely. But again, when you have a one vote margin,
whose vote are you going to pick up by doing more cuts? I guess you get
Thomas Massie maybe. But you probably have to go all the way to balance
the budget to get his vote. I don't know what it takes to get a Thomas
Massie vote. So, I don't know what votes you think you're going to pick
up by cutting even more. And we can't afford to lose even one vote. It's
literally the art of the game.

\[中文翻译\]
这项法案在十年内削减了8800亿美元的医疗补助（Medicaid）开支，这本身在政治上就很艰难且备受争议。它对有劳动能力的成年人规定了工作要求。这类似于比尔·克林顿在1996年福利改革时所做的。基本上是说你不能游手好闲还领取福利。所以这些在政治上是相对难以做到的事情。就像我是否想看到更多的削减？是的，绝对如此。但再说一遍，当你只有一票的多数时，通过进行更多削减，你能争取到谁的选票？我想你可能会得到托马斯·马西（Thomas
Massie）的选票。但你可能必须一直做到平衡预算才能得到他的选票。我不知道要怎样才能得到托马斯·马西的选票。所以，我不知道你认为通过进一步削减能争取到哪些选票。而且我们连一票都输不起。这简直就是博弈的艺术。

JCal:

We got to move on. I will move on. But if you're going to tell me it's
I'm asking virtual signal, you're going to lie about my position, I will
correct it. It's been 40 minutes. So, my position is not to virtual
signal. It's to go flip a couple people and say, "Do better." Okay.

\[中文翻译\]
我们得继续了。我会继续。但如果你要说我是在要求道德表演，你要歪曲我的立场，我会纠正它。已经40分钟了。所以，我的立场不是道德表演。而是去说服几个人，让他们“做得更好”。好吧。



## 谷歌 AI 搜索与 OpenAI 的新动向

<div class="dialogue">

JCal:

It was a huge week for AI again. Google and the ghost of Steve Jobs took
center stage. Let's start with Google here. They had their IO conference
on Tuesday. This is where they show a bunch of new stuff. They get
developers to come together to embrace their products and the stock
ripped 5% on the day which might be a turning point for Google and up
again today. Search was the big announcement and we had a discussion
with Sergey about that in Miami and we had multiple discussions about it
here over the last couple of months. They demoed something called AI
mode. No, not founder mode, AI mode and they compared it to regular
search. Here it is on the screen if you're watching us on YouTube or
Spotify. A very elegant app. And so here you have somebody searching and
what you can see is in AI mode. It looks like a nice comprehensive
search. Instead of 10 blue links and tons of advertising. So you can
flip over and see all or you can do a perplexity like search. Here we're
showing you what this search would have looked like. The AI summary at
the top and then your 10 blue links. It's distinctly different. It is
exactly Chamath what you talked about. Somebody has to have the courage
to flip the switch here. And so that's was the big drop. And I think
that in your interview Dave, didn't Sundar say we're going to integrate
ads into that kind of result? Yes. The comprehensive search result.

\[中文翻译\]
这又是人工智能领域意义重大的一周。谷歌和史蒂夫·乔布斯的“幽灵”成为了焦点。我们先从谷歌开始。他们周二举行了IO开发者大会。这是他们展示一系列新产品的地方。他们让开发者齐聚一堂，拥抱他们的产品，当天股价大涨5%，这可能是谷歌的一个转折点，今天股价再次上涨。搜索是最大的发布内容，我们在迈阿密与谢尔盖（Sergey
Brin）讨论过这个问题，过去几个月我们在这里也多次讨论过。他们演示了一种叫做AI模式的东西。不，不是创始人模式，是AI模式，他们将其与常规搜索进行了比较。如果你在YouTube或Spotify上观看，屏幕上就有显示。一个非常优雅的应用程序。所以这里有人在搜索，你可以看到在AI模式下，它看起来像一个不错的综合搜索结果，而不是10个蓝色链接和大量的广告。所以你可以切换查看全部结果，或者进行类似Perplexity的搜索。这里我们展示了这个搜索结果的样子。顶部是AI摘要，然后是你的10个蓝色链接。这截然不同。Chamath，这正是你所说的。必须有人有勇气在这里做出改变。这就是那次重大的发布。而且我认为，Dave，在你的采访中，桑达尔（Sundar
Pichai）是不是说过他们会将广告整合到那种结果中？是的。综合搜索结果。

David Sacks:

I think there were a couple of things that Sundar said in the interview
that showed up in a really important way at IO. The first was exactly
this which is to make AI mode more ubiquitous in search and effectively
over time replace search with this AI mode experience which they've been
testing in a small group and now they've expanded very specifically to
kind of Chamath's point a couple weeks ago they should try and flip the
switch. Well, it appears they've done that. The key question and the
challenge has always been what's the revenue per query? How are you
going to make money? And I think one of the other kind of interesting
announcements that we saw come out of IO which indicates the business
model opportunity here is not just AI mode and search but some of the
other tools that they launched bundling them together and they have this
product offering called AI ultra for \$250 a month that includes you
know YouTube premium. It includes 30 terabytes of storage on your Google
account. It includes access to flow which is their movie creating AI
model where you can use they have V3, Gemini and imagen below it. Those
are the three models that contribute to this movie creation studio tool
and they've launched a number of other kind of highv value Gemini models
as standalone research apps and you can get access to all of these kind
of high-powered tools for \$250. So I do think this sets a new direction
that Google is likely testing as a business model which is subscriptions
you're saying. Can we make yeah a very high dollar volume subscription
model for consumers that over time could create a very meaningful shift
in the revenue mix for Google away from ads and more towards
subscription revenue that we already see in some of the consumer
services like YouTube and YouTube TV. This is I think a really important
turning point. I would say if anyone were to identify the week that
Google really pivoted into the AI business model it might be this week.
They launched over 15 products at this thing. And another important one
I'll highlight, Sundar talked about this in the interview uh I did with
him. In the early days of Google from 2002 till about 2011, Google had
this kind of playground of products called Google Labs where they would
introduce new stuff. I don't know if you guys remember checking out new
stuff. So they relaunched Google Labs like a year ago or so and as
Sundar said they're putting a lot more stuff in labs. So Labs is now
becoming the new test bed and they launched a bunch of the announcements
in labs. So that becomes the place where they'll say what's the business
model, what's the use case, do people like it, do they love it? If they
do, it graduates out of labs into full production. And I think that
opens up the opportunity for some of the things like Chamath was talking
about where they could experiment new ideas, new modalities, and then
productize them if they work. And they discontinued labs in 2011. They
just brought it back last year. They just brought it back. Yeah.

\[中文翻译\]
我认为桑达尔在采访中说的几件事在IO大会上以非常重要的方式体现了出来。第一件就是这个，即让AI模式在搜索中更加普及，并随着时间的推移，用这种AI模式体验有效地取代传统搜索。他们之前在一个小范围内测试过，现在他们非常明确地扩展了，就像
Chamath
几周前指出的那样，他们应该尝试做出改变。嗯，看起来他们已经这样做了。关键问题和挑战一直是每次查询的收入是多少？你将如何赚钱？我认为我们在IO大会上看到的另一个有趣的公告，它揭示了这里的商业模式机会，不仅仅是AI模式和搜索，还有他们推出的其他一些工具，将它们捆绑在一起。他们有一个名为
AI Ultra 的产品，每月250美元，其中包括了YouTube
Premium。它包括你谷歌账户上的30TB存储空间。它还包括访问 Flow
的权限，那是他们的电影创作AI模型，你可以使用他们底层的 V3、Gemini 和
Imagen
模型。这三个模型共同构成了这个电影创作工作室工具。他们还推出了一些其他高价值的
Gemini
模型作为独立的研究应用程序，你可以用250美元获得所有这些强大的工具。所以我确实认为这为谷歌设定了一个新的方向，他们可能正在测试一种商业模式，也就是你说的订阅模式。我们能否为消费者建立一个非常高客单价的订阅模式，随着时间的推移，这可能会导致谷歌收入结构发生非常有意义的转变，从广告转向订阅收入，就像我们已经在YouTube和YouTube
TV等一些消费者服务中看到的那样。我认为这是一个非常重要的转折点。如果有人要确定谷歌真正转向AI商业模式的那一周，可能就是本周。他们在此次大会上推出了超过15款产品。我还要强调另一个重要的点，桑达尔在我对他的采访中谈到了这一点。在谷歌的早期，从2002年到大约2011年，谷歌有一个叫做Google
Labs的产品试验场，他们会在那里推出新东西。我不知道你们是否还记得去查看新东西。所以他们大约一年前重新启动了Google
Labs，正如桑达尔所说，他们正在Labs里放更多东西。所以Labs现在成为了新的试验田，他们在Labs里发布了很多公告。因此，Labs成为了他们判断商业模式、使用场景、人们是否喜欢、是否热爱的地方。如果反响好，它就会从Labs毕业，进入全面生产。我认为这为
Chamath
谈到的一些事情提供了机会，他们可以在那里试验新的想法、新的模式，如果可行就将其产品化。他们在2011年停止了Labs。他们去年才重新恢复。是的，他们刚恢复不久。

JCal:

Sacks, you I think mentioned, hey, they have the I'm feeling lucky
button here. They put the AI search up in the top bar. We have images,
video, shopping, etc. news. We're all familiar with that. What do you
think? Just swap out I'm feeling lucky for Delight Me with AI and or
maybe just if you were a product manager there because you've done a lot
of great product work in your career before you were in politics, would
you just AB test this and say anybody who let's say doesn't click on
ads, let's send them to the AI search and just see how they do because
they don't click on ads anyway and then just let the ad clickers keep
going to the ad product.

\[中文翻译\]
Sacks，我记得你提到过，嘿，他们这里有“手气不错”按钮。他们把AI搜索放在了顶部栏。我们有图片、视频、购物等等新闻。我们都熟悉这些。你觉得呢？
просто把“手气不错”换成“用AI给我惊喜”，或者，如果你是那里的产品经理——因为你在从政前在职业生涯中做过很多出色的产品工作——你会不会就进行A/B测试，然后说，比如说，任何不点击广告的人，我们就把他们导向AI搜索，看看效果如何，因为他们反正也不点广告，然后就让那些点广告的人继续使用广告产品。

David Sacks:

Well, I think you know we were all calling on previous podcasts for
Google to risk disrupting their dominance in search by moving to more of
an AI based model. And I think they've taken an important step in that
direction. They've sort of threaded the needle here between keeping
their old UI and product and then also incorporating the new sort of AI
UI. So, this is a compromise. I mean, they're trying to have their cake
and eat it too. It ultimately feels a little bit like a transitional
move. I doubt that this will be the end point, but given their need to
protect their search business while also developing their AI business,
this feels like a pretty good compromise, I think. I mean, it certainly
shows that they're in the game and they're not going to get caught
totally flatfooted and let the whole world disrupt them while they're
trying to figure out AI. I mean, they are responding now and the market
seemed to like it. I think they were up like 5% on this news.

\[中文翻译\]
嗯，我想你知道我们之前在播客中都呼吁谷歌冒险颠覆其在搜索领域的统治地位，转向更基于人工智能的模型。我认为他们在这方面迈出了重要的一步。他们在这里算是巧妙地取得了平衡，既保留了旧的用户界面和产品，又融入了新的人工智能用户界面。所以，这是一种妥协。我的意思是，他们试图鱼与熊掌兼得。这最终感觉有点像一个过渡性的举措。我怀疑这不会是终点，但考虑到他们既要保护搜索业务，又要发展人工智能业务，这感觉像是一个相当不错的妥协，我认为。我的意思是，这无疑表明他们参与其中，不会完全措手不及，任由整个世界在他们试图弄清楚人工智能的时候颠覆他们。我的意思是，他们现在正在做出回应，市场似乎也喜欢这一点。我认为因为这个消息，他们的股价上涨了大约5%。

JCal:

Yeah. And then up again today. Chamath, you talked about having some uh
design sense and maybe some bravery here. Looks like uh they're pretty
much on the cusp of doing that. The search alerts results in AI look
elegant. They look uh dare I say perplexity like when you look at them.
I would say I would like to have that as my default. I think when I'm
doing search, what do you think of the product? We're showing it here
again. And what do you think the road map will be? I gave one
possibility.

\[中文翻译\]
是的。然后今天又涨了。Chamath，你谈到过这里需要一些设计感和一些勇气。看起来他们差不多就要做到那一点了。AI中的搜索结果看起来很优雅。它们看起来……我敢说，当你看着它们的时候，有点像Perplexity的风格。我想说，我希望把它作为我的默认设置。我认为当我在进行搜索时，你对这个产品有什么看法？我们在这里再次展示它。你认为路线图会是怎样的？我给出了一个可能性。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

Sacks is totally right. I think that this is not the destination, but
they've taken a really important step and now they have to follow
through. We all know what has to happen. So, I think we're all just
going to debate when it happens and I think what the market is betting
is that it's going to happen in the next 18 months. So what is it
exactly? It's when AI mode becomes the default for a large swath of
existing Google users. How will we know that happens? They're probably
running AB tests right now. They're probably gauging behavioral patterns
of which kinds of users, what the actual impacts to search are, and what
impacts exist to CPCs to cost per click, which is one of the inventory
types that they sell. But I think this is the beginning of a process. I
suspect it'll be done in less than a year. And for a large swath of
users, they are going to put AI in the front door. I think that's a feta
compli. I think we're just now debating the mechanics of getting there
per how Sacks alluded to it. That's a really powerful step. But here's
Jason. I think I go back to what they also have to keep in mind. What
you don't want to have when you are going through an innovator's dilemma
is to have the competitor be on to the next lily pad while you are
figuring out the current lily pad. And the reason I bring this up, and
I'm sure we'll talk about this, is it's impressive what Sam Altman is
doing right now at OpenAI. I don't know if it was a troll or not, but to
buy IO, Jony Ive's firm at the end of Google IO. And I read an article
that said OpenAI has been trying to do this for a couple years in a row.
But what Sam alluded to in that video was some nextgen whisbang device
that they've been working on. That was the industrial logic for the M&A.
I think what you don't want to have happen if you're Google is to
finally get the search thing right and then now have to play catchup on
some device. So I would encourage them to just run the AB tests and
shorten the window of measurement. I think we all know what has to
happen. So, it's probably better to just do it sooner than later and
then start to allocate the incremental resources to these new form
factors and other things so that they shorten the distance between them
and open AI.

\[中文翻译\] Sacks
完全正确。我认为这不是最终目的地，但他们迈出了非常重要的一步，现在他们必须坚持下去。我们都知道必须发生什么。所以，我认为我们现在只是在争论它何时发生，而且我认为市场押注的是它将在未来18个月内发生。那么具体是什么呢？就是当AI模式成为大量现有谷歌用户的默认设置时。我们怎么知道这会发生？他们现在可能正在进行A/B测试。他们可能正在衡量哪些类型用户的行为模式，对搜索的实际影响是什么，以及对CPC（每次点击成本）——他们销售的广告库存类型之一——存在哪些影响。但我认为这是一个过程的开始。我怀疑它会在不到一年的时间内完成。对于大量用户，他们会将AI放在最显眼的位置。我认为这是既成事实（feta
compli，应为 fait
accompli）。我认为我们现在只是在讨论如何实现这一点，正如 Sacks
所暗示的那样。这是非常强大的一步。但是，Jason，我想回到他们也必须牢记的一点。当你在经历创新者的窘境时，你不希望竞争对手已经跳到了下一个荷叶上，而你还在琢磨当前的荷叶。我之所以提到这一点，而且我相信我们会讨论到，是因为萨姆·奥尔特曼（Sam
Altman）目前在OpenAI所做的事情令人印象深刻。我不知道这是不是一种挑衅，但在谷歌IO大会结束时收购IO，Jony
Ive的公司。我读到一篇文章说OpenAI已经连续几年试图这么做了。但萨姆在那个视频中提到的是他们一直在研发的某种下一代炫酷设备。那是这次并购的产业逻辑。我认为，如果你是谷歌，你不希望发生的事情是最终把搜索搞定了，然后现在又不得不在某个设备上追赶。所以我鼓励他们只进行A/B测试，并缩短衡量的时间窗口。我想我们都知道必须发生什么。所以，可能最好是尽早行动，然后开始将增量资源分配给这些新的形态因素和其他事物，以便他们缩短与OpenAI之间的差距。

JCal:

Let me tee up exactly what happened. OpenAI, they're the makers of Chat
GPT, bought Jony Ive's startup. The startup is called IO. They bought it
for 6.5 billion in an all stock deal. If you remember, Jony Ive was
Steve Jobs collaborator and designer. iPhone, iPod, iPad, all that
beautiful stuff. So, OpenAI is buying IO. IO is not loved from, if
you've heard about that. That's his design agency. And so, they did a a
really interesting romcom video. I don't know if you guys saw this. It's
incredibly ridiculous. Let's play it. Here are two people having a meet
cute. Dude, you're right. It's like a love story. It literally is like a
meet cute. Here comes Sam. He's walking around San Francisco and he's a
genius according to this video. Here's what I have said about Jony. I
was like, I've never met a man who's so brilliant and so humble. I mean,
it's embarrassing the language. The responsibility that Sam bears is
actually honestly beyond my comprehension. He's a co-founder of IO.
Yeah. Open AI already owns 20% of it. Yes. No, no, 23%. As all Sam
Altman deals, if you learned anything, they're conflicted. But the the
copy here I just want to get your general the gentleman's comment on
what I see you worrying about are other people or about customers about
society about culture and to me that tells me everything I want to know
about. Surprised you guys are such haters on this. I'm excited to see
what this thing is but I just thought this was like... You're falling
for it. The deepest... I don't know why we're even watching but they're
going to watch the 9-minute video. I wanted my 9 minutes back. Nothing
happened. I want the device. They say they have a device. Okay, I'm
giving them the benefit of the doubt. They've invented something that
they say is world changing. Okay, but they this is again I'm just using
their words and he's sipping a macchiato there. So that's important. Oh
my god, you are so falling for the espresso video. This is your problem.
Jam, look at the glasses. I think the clue is in the video. Look at
Jony's glasses. The fact that we're even talking about this such a
problem.

\[中文翻译\]
让我来准确描述一下发生了什么。OpenAI，Chat
GPT的创造者，收购了 Jony Ive
的初创公司。这家初创公司叫做IO。他们以65亿美元的全股票交易收购了它。如果你还记得，Jony
Ive
是史蒂夫·乔布斯的合作者和设计师。iPhone、iPod、iPad，所有那些漂亮的东西。所以，OpenAI
正在收购IO。IO
并不受（LoveFrom，他之前的设计公司）待见，如果你听说过的话。那是他的设计机构。所以，他们拍了一个非常有趣的浪漫喜剧视频。我不知道你们看没看。简直荒谬至极。我们放一下。这里是两个人浪漫邂逅的场景。老兄，你说得对。这就像一个爱情故事。简直就是浪漫邂逅。萨姆来了。他在旧金山四处走动，根据这个视频，他是个天才。这是我对
Jony
的评价。我说过，我从未见过如此才华横溢又如此谦逊的人。我的意思是，这种措辞令人尴尬。“萨姆所承担的责任，老实说，超出了我的理解范围。”他是IO的联合创始人。是的。OpenAI
已经拥有其20%的股份。是的。不，不，是23%。就像所有萨姆·奥尔特曼的交易一样，如果你学到了什么，那就是它们都存在利益冲突。但是这里的文案……我只是想听听你们先生们对你们所担心的——是关于其他人、客户、社会还是文化——的总体评论，对我来说，这告诉了我所有我想知道的。很惊讶你们这么讨厌这个。我很兴奋想看看这到底是什么，但我只是觉得这就像……你上当了。最深的……我不知道我们为什么要看这个，但他们会看这个9分钟的视频。我想要回我的9分钟。什么都没发生。我想要那个设备。他们说他们有一个设备。好吧，我姑且相信他们。他们发明了一些他们声称可以改变世界的东西。好吧，但这……我再说一遍，我只是在引用他们的话，他还在那里喝着玛奇朵。所以这很重要。哦我的天，你完全被那个浓缩咖啡视频骗了。这是你的问题。Chamath，看看那副眼镜。我认为线索就在视频里。看看
Jony 的眼镜。我们竟然在谈论这个，这本身就是个问题。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

Let me tell you my 2007 my 2007 Apple iPhone moment. Steve announced the
iPhone. I got one of the I don't know first like few hundred few
thousand. I was going to Vegas. So I got it on a Friday and I had it in
my hand. The way that people looked at me for those three days. I've
never been looked like at that ever or since. They liked you. People
like what you were feeling was love and admiration. All I had All I had
was music. There was no multiple screens. You couldn't buy app stores.
Yeah. But it was so mesmerizing. And my point is, you're right. I may
have fallen for it, which may seem crazy, but when I saw that video, I
thought, hey, hold on. All I'm saying is if there is a next generation
device that they or somebody else, my my only comment is I think Google
is so wonderful. I love the people there. I just want them to be on the
forward foot and I just don't want them to be reacting for the next five
years. That's all I'm...

让我告诉你我2007年，我的2007年苹果iPhone时刻。史蒂夫发布了iPhone。我拿到了最早的那几百、几千部中的一部，具体不清楚了。我当时要去拉斯维加斯。所以我周五拿到了它，握在手里。那三天里人们看我的眼神。我以前和以后再也没有被那样看过。他们喜欢你。人们喜欢……你感觉到的是爱和钦佩。我当时只有音乐。没有多屏。你不能购买应用商店。是的。但它是如此令人着迷。我的观点是，你说得对。我可能上当了，这可能看起来很疯狂，但当我看到那个视频时，我想，嘿，等等。我想说的是，如果他们或其他什么人真的有下一代设备，我唯一的评论是，我认为谷歌非常棒。我喜欢那里的人。我只是希望他们能主动出击，不希望他们在未来五年里只是被动反应。这就是我全部的……

Sacks:

Here's what Sam said about Jony. Jony is the deepest thinker of anyone
I've ever met. I mean, this was a love story. I'm not justifying what
they said about each other. Okay, let's handicap it here. I'll tell you
exactly what's happening. It's the glasses. He's wearing the glasses in
there. They're making smart glasses.

\[中文翻译\] 这是萨姆对 Jony 的评价。“Jony
是我见过的思想最深刻的人。”我的意思是，这是一个爱情故事。我不是在为他们互相吹捧的话辩护。好吧，我们来分析一下。我来告诉你到底是怎么回事。是那副眼镜。他在里面戴着眼镜。他们在制造智能眼镜。

JCal:

Sacks, what are they making? What are these two guys up to? You know
these guys. You know both of them for 20 years. Come on now. You know
what's going on. Just spill the beans.

\[中文翻译\]
Sacks，他们在做什么？这两个家伙在搞什么名堂？你认识这些人。你认识他们俩都20年了。拜托了。你知道怎么回事。快点说出来。

David Sacks:

Let me spill it. Let me express a hot take here. But let me express in
the form of a question cuz I don't want to I don't want to be too
definitive with the rhetoric. Okay, go which is is Jony Ive just a media
creation? I mean no seriously just did Steve Jobs manifest him? Well, I
know he did good work at Apple, okay, don't get me wrong, but the
software was done by someone else, right? So, he did like the beautiful
Eddie. So, you know, the whole and Scott industrial design. Yes, the
hardware looks beautiful with a beveled edge to paint a glass with a
beveled edge. Okay, great. So, he has this beautiful English accent
which everyone associates with intelligence, right? So he could describe
anything and it's going to sound amazing and taste and taste 15%
smarter, right? So I don't know. I mean, maybe he's like parlayed this
incredible reputation that he's built in the media into 2% of open AI.
Open AI. It's incredible. I mean, what a trade. What a trade. Do you
think it was done at that \$300 billion price? You think it was done at
like a cheaper price? Yes. Yes. Yeah. I mean, there is an argument. I'm
going to go in Sacks's corner here. I'm going to go into Conspiracy
Corner here. I'm going to say Dieter Rams designed the iPhone, not Jony
Ive. Pull it up, Nick. Well, I'm going to say Tony Fadell designed the
iPhone. Okay. But if you don't know who Dieter Rams is, I mean, if you
look at the transistor radio, made the iPod. If you pull up the Braun
radio, here is the power Mac. If you look at the iMac, basically what
did Steve Jobs... Are you accusing Jony Ive of ripping off a German
industrial designer? What I'm saying is immature artists copy, mature
artist steal. I am saying 90% of what Apple did was steal Dieter Rams
design. I will die on that hill. 90% stolen. Jony Ive has been knighted.
He's Sir Jony. He took Dieter Rams' knighthood. That's what he did. Sir
Jony. I mean, Sir John, he did put the handle on an iMac, right? I mean,
so you got that. Stop. He did. You can move those iMacs around. So
slanderous. Stop you guys. This is so brutal. So great, dude. Look at
this one. Pull this one up, Nick. Everybody knows the iconic iMac. I
hate to break your hearts, folks. Totally ripped off from Dieter. It was
all inspired by the Germans. Sorry. So you're saying Dieter Braun is
like the Keyser Söze of our entire physical world. Look, here's the
speaker on the left. Look at the iMac on the right. These guys took
every design that Dieter did in the 60s and 70s, even the 50s, and they
photocopied it and they put an Apple logo on it. I couldn't... Stop.
Stop. Stop. Stop. Sacks, am I wrong? Stop. I didn't know about the
Dieter Braun angle. I mean, listen, it is what it is. I mean, look,
everyone at Apple did amazing work. There's no question about it. But
but I but I'm just saying like I don't quite get this like design god
reputation that's been created a little bit. But but I would say that
it's certainly a brilliant idea to parlay that into 2%. By the way, is
that what San Francisco looks like? Like I never thought every time I go
to San Francisco it's so disgusting and it's cloudy and cold. But yes,
did they find the one day where like the sun was shining in that
hellscape? Yeah, there were no homeless people and there was no
fentanyl. I don't know what happened. Yuck. On a serious note, what I
would say is maybe what this deal indicates is, I mean, obviously, is
that OpenAI is going to do something with hardware. Sure. It could be a
new kind of phone that is AI first as opposed to the wall of
applications. Or maybe it's like some sort of like pendant thing that
like tracks what's going on around you and feeds it into AI so it can
give you more context. You know, maybe like in the movie Her. Who knows?
But it seems like they'll do something with devices in the physical
world.

\[中文翻译\]
让我来揭秘。让我在这里发表一个大胆的看法。但我会以问题的形式表达，因为我不想在言辞上过于绝对。好吧，说吧，Jony
Ive
仅仅是媒体的创造物吗？我的意思是，不开玩笑，真的是史蒂夫·乔布斯塑造了他吗？嗯，我知道他在苹果做得很好，别误会，但软件是别人做的，对吧？所以，他设计了漂亮的……你知道的，整个工业设计，比如漂亮的边缘，给玻璃加上斜边。好的，很棒。所以，他有这种优美的英国口音，每个人都把它与智慧联系起来，对吧？所以他可以描述任何东西，听起来都会很棒，而且感觉上会聪明15%，对吧？所以我不知道。我的意思是，也许他把他在媒体上建立起来的这种不可思议的声誉，转化成了OpenAI
2%的股份。OpenAI。太不可思议了。我的意思是，多划算的交易啊。多划算的交易。你认为这是按那个3000亿美元的价格做的吗？你认为是以更便宜的价格做的吗？是的。是的。是的。我的意思是，有一种说法。我这里要站
Sacks 这一边。我要进入阴谋论的角落了。我要说迪特·拉姆斯（Dieter
Rams）设计了iPhone，而不是 Jony
Ive。Nick，把它调出来。嗯，我要说托尼·法德尔（Tony
Fadell）设计了iPhone。好的。但如果你不知道迪特·拉姆斯是谁，我的意思是，如果你看看晶体管收音机，它启发了iPod。如果你调出博朗（Braun）收音机，这就是Power
Mac。如果你看看iMac，基本上史蒂夫·乔布斯做了什么……你是在指责 Jony Ive
抄袭了一位德国工业设计师吗？我想说的是，不成熟的艺术家复制，成熟的艺术家窃取。我说苹果90%的设计都是窃取迪特·拉姆斯的设计。我坚信这一点。90%是偷来的。Jony
Ive
已经被封为爵士了。他是乔尼爵士。他夺走了迪特·拉姆斯的爵位。他就是这么做的。乔尼爵士。我的意思是，约翰爵士，他确实在iMac上加了个把手，对吧？我的意思是，所以你明白了。停。他确实做了。你可以把那些iMac搬来搬去。太诽谤了。住手，你们这些家伙。这太残忍了。太棒了，老兄。看看这个。Nick，把这个调出来。每个人都知道标志性的iMac。我不想伤你们的心，各位。完全是从迪特那里抄来的。全是德国人的灵感。抱歉。所以你是说迪特·博朗（Dieter
Braun，应为Dieter Rams/Braun）就像我们整个物质世界的凯撒·索泽（Keyser
Söze）。看，左边是扬声器。右边是iMac。这些家伙把迪特在60年代、70年代，甚至50年代做的每一个设计都拿过来，复印了一下，然后贴上了苹果的标志。我不能……停。停。停。停。Sacks，我错了吗？停。我不知道迪特·博朗那个角度。我的意思是，听着，事实就是如此。我的意思是，你看，苹果的每个人都做了出色的工作。毫无疑问。但是我只是想说，我不太明白这种被塑造出来的“设计之神”的声誉。但我会说，把这种声誉转化为2%的股份，无疑是个绝妙的主意。顺便问一下，旧金山是那个样子吗？我总觉得每次去旧金山都那么恶心，而且阴冷。但是，是的，他们是不是找到了那个地狱般的城市里阳光普照的一天？是的，没有无家可归的人，也没有芬太尼。我不知道发生了什么。恶心。严肃地说，我想说的是，也许这笔交易表明，我的意思是，很明显，OpenAI
要在硬件方面有所作为。当然。它可能是一种新型的AI优先手机，而不是一堆应用程序的堆砌。或者它可能是一种类似吊坠的东西，可以追踪你周围发生的事情，并将其输入AI，以便为你提供更多背景信息。你知道，也许就像电影《她》（Her）里那样。谁知道呢？但看起来他们会在物理世界中用设备做些什么。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

So that would be the play, I guess. I guess the question you have to ask
is, will it make Open AI 1% more valuable? If it's a \$300 billion
company, 2% more valuable. Yes, thank you. Will it make it more than 2%
more valuable? If it makes it 1% more valuable, it was worth the swing,
I guess. Right.

\[中文翻译\]
所以我想这就是他们的计划。我想你必须问的问题是，这会使OpenAI的价值增加1%吗？如果它是一家价值3000亿美元的公司，那就是增加2%的价值。是的，谢谢。它会使它的价值增加超过2%吗？如果它能使价值增加1%，我想那也值得一试。对。

JCal:

I heard an interesting factoid yesterday which is by somebody who was
looking at OpenAI equity. All of the rounds before the \$300 billion
round from SoftBank had essentially a feature where there was like a
hard rate of return and the ability tax or something. No, but the
ability to put the stock back if they weren't able to do the conversion
to a for-profit company, etc., etc. And in the \$300 billion round,
apparently it's much cleaner and it's essentially like sub new co that
is owned. And I thought to myself like, wow, at at those valuations, I
would have expected the terms to ratchet up. And instead, it seems like
the terms have ratcheted down, which is I don't It's either it's either
commentary on the negotiating prowess of OpenAI and their team and or
the riskmanagement philosophy of SoftBank and the lack thereof.

\[中文翻译\]
我昨天听到了一个有趣的小道消息，来自一个正在研究OpenAI股权的人。在软银那轮3000亿美元融资之前的所有轮融资，基本上都有一个特点，就是有类似硬性回报率和能力税之类的东西。不，但如果他们无法将其转换为营利性公司等，就有能力将股票退回。而在3000亿美元的那轮融资中，显然情况要干净得多，基本上就像是一个拥有的新的子公司。我当时想，哇，在那种估值下，我本以为条款会收紧。但相反，条款似乎放宽了，这……我不知道……这要么是对OpenAI及其团队谈判能力的评论，要么是对软银风险管理理念及其缺乏的评论。

David Sacks:

I do think you know he is a great designer and he will make it one or
two% better. Design matters. So if he makes it I mean there's a chance
right Sachs that he could make the product five or 10% better through
design. I don't think it's going to be one or two% better. I think it's
going to be either zero or a doubling of the company's value. Something
like that. Right. like either he develops an iPhone like amazing hit
product no one's seen before some new consumer device that you know
really could take the company to another level or probably they do
something that kind of doesn't work. So it's more of like a 2% option
against a strike of doubling the value of the company.

\[中文翻译\]
我确实认为他是一位伟大的设计师，他会让产品好上百分之一二。设计很重要。所以如果他真的做到了……我的意思是，Sacks，他通过设计让产品好上百分之五或百分之十是有可能的，对吧？我不认为只会好百分之一二。我认为要么是零，要么是公司价值翻倍。类似这样。对。比如，他要么开发出一款像iPhone那样前所未见的惊人热门产品，某种新的消费设备，你知道，真的能把公司带到另一个层面；要么他们可能会做一些不起作用的事情。所以这更像是用2%的期权去博取公司价值翻倍的机会。

JCal:

I'm surprised it hasn't leaked because in the in Sam's update or
whatever he said that the that the executive team was shown the device
and that he has it. Who? So what is it? It's it's definitely going to be
a pendant or glasses. It's got to be those two form factors. He was the
investor in Humane. Remember, wasn't that the pendant from the Apple
people? Yeah. I will take the field against that. What are the odds and
how much money do you want to bet? Okay, here we go. So I think it's a a
pendant like a wearable. We'd have to define that. So like humane. I'll
say it's not a pendant. Okay. Glasses. I get What are you going to give
me? You give me odds. I'll give you Give me odds. Well, we'll just do
even money. Let's do even money. Even money. I don't know. Whatever you
want. How However many thousands of dollars you want to bet. Even money.
How about you give me two to one 10 dimes? Cuz you have every option. I
have to pick them. No. No. No. That's a pretty good bet. This is my You
want to get in on the bet here?

\[中文翻译\]
我很惊讶它还没有泄露，因为在萨姆的更新或其他什么中，他说高管团队已经看到了这个设备，而且他拥有它。谁？那它到底是什么？它肯定会是吊坠或眼镜。肯定是这两种形态。他是Humane的投资者。还记得吗，那不是苹果那帮人做的吊坠吗？是的。我反对这个说法。赔率是多少，你想赌多少钱？好吧，开始了。所以我认为它是一个吊坠，像可穿戴设备。我们得定义一下。就像Humane那样。我会说它不是吊坠。好吧。眼镜。我明白了，你打算给我什么？你给我赔率。我给你……给我赔率。嗯，我们就按等额赌注吧。就等额赌注。等额赌注。我不知道。随你便。你想赌多少千美元都行。等额赌注。要不你给我二赔一，赌十块？因为你什么选项都有。我得选一个。不。不。不。这赌注不错。这是我的……你想加入这个赌局吗？



## Sacks 的中东之行与 AI 外交

<div class="dialogue">

JCal:

All right. We covered Trump's trip to the Middle East last week, but our
bestie Sacks was there as well. Um and uh you did uh you got a couple
photos to show and uh you met a lot of friends there. Tell us about the
experience of did you go first of all did you go on Air Force One?
That's what everybody wants to know. Or did you go on AirSacks? I took
my own plane. So I know that sounds a little bit like a flex but were
you were you in formation with Air Force One? Were you like you know
just right behind it or on your own travel? You were on your own travel
schedule. I was I was doing my own my own thing. But did you have the
option to go on Air Force One? I probably could have if I wanted to, but
I I actually wanted to get to the region a little bit early cuz I hadn't
been before and I kind of checked it out and so I was waiting there when
the president arrived. Oh wow. So it was your first time in the region.
Yeah. Well, tell us about your impressions generally and uh what were
you trying to accomplish there as the Czar?

\[中文翻译\] 好的。我们上周报道了特朗普的中东之行，但我们的好兄弟 Sacks
当时也在那里。嗯，而且……你拍了几张照片要展示，还在那里见了很多朋友。跟我们说说这次经历……首先，你乘坐空军一号了吗？这是大家都想知道的。还是你乘坐的是“Sacks
专机”？我坐的是我自己的飞机。我知道这听起来有点像在炫耀，但是……你当时是和空军一号编队飞行吗？你是……你知道，就在它后面，还是按你自己的行程？你是按你自己的行程安排的。我……我当时在忙我自己的事。但你当时有机会乘坐空军一号吗？如果我想的话，我大概是可以的，但我实际上想早点到达那个地区，因为我以前没去过，所以我想先去看看，所以总统到达时我已经在那里等了。哦，哇。所以那是你第一次去那个地区。是的。嗯，跟我们说说你总体的印象，以及作为“沙皇”，你试图在那里完成什么？

David Sacks:

Well, I call it AI diplomacy. First of all, these countries are
obviously they're very resource-rich. They've got a lot of capital to
deploy and they're also very interested in diversifying their economies.
They're very interested in high-tech and they want to do things in AI.
They've got very significant aspirations there and so I was over there
just to kind of listen and learn and see what they're interested in
doing and I also got to see some of their tech scenes and just... Oh,
you went to Digital Garage in Riyadh, right? I've been there. Oh, you've
been there? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, it's um they are really pushing
entrepreneurship, trying to generate more ideas and teach people how to
start companies and co-working spaces, all kinds of incentives in terms
of visas to come to Riyadh, to come to UAE, you know, Dubai, Abu Dhabi
specifically. So, yeah. Right. I'm curious your impression of the
individuals who are leading a lot of these different groups. I was
really taken back by how much time they had spent in the West. It seemed
like every single person I had met had taken one of these scholarships
to go to Oxford to Harvard to you know Caltech whatever it was they all
had spent massive amounts of time in the west and then come back to
either Saudi or UAE or Oman etc. So maybe you could talk a little bit
about the people and their knowledge base motivation etc.

\[中文翻译\]
嗯，我称之为AI外交。首先，这些国家显然资源非常丰富。他们有大量资本可以部署，而且他们也非常有兴趣实现经济多元化。他们对高科技非常感兴趣，并希望在人工智能领域有所作为。他们在这方面有非常远大的抱负，所以我去那里主要是为了倾听、学习，看看他们有兴趣做什么，我还参观了一些他们的科技场景，只是……哦，你去了利雅得的
Digital
Garage，对吧？我去过那里。哦，你去过？好的。是的。是的。不，不，是……他们确实在推动创业，试图产生更多想法，教人们如何创办公司，还有共享办公空间，各种签证方面的激励措施，吸引人们来利雅得，来阿联酋，你知道，特别是迪拜和阿布扎比。所以，是的。对。我很好奇你对领导这些不同群体的个人的印象。我真的被他们在西方度过的时间之长所震撼。似乎我遇到的每一个人都曾获得过这类奖学金去牛津、哈佛，你知道，加州理工学院等等，他们都在西方度过了大量时间，然后回到沙特、阿联酋或阿曼等国。所以也许你可以谈谈这些人以及他们的知识基础、动机等等。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

I had the same observation. The elites of all these countries have all
been educated in the west, usually in the United States, some in the UK.
The leadership tends to be young, visionary, future oriented, intensely
interested in AI, like I was saying, and they want to do big things in
AI. The thing that that's been in their way is that in October 2023, the
Biden administration basically put a a blanket on the whole region
acquiring semiconductors, GPUs, and it it required that every export of
a GPU or a server that contains a GPU had to get a specific license from
the commerce department. And it put a major damper on their efforts to
do things like build data centers in the region or to have their own
local AI efforts. So, they've been kind of in this holding pattern where
the Biden administration decided to kind of alienate them. And, you
know, it wasn't just AI, there was other things, too. Remember the fist
bump? And the Biden administration was very, I'd say, hostile,
standoffish, cool to, and even hostile towards these states in the
region. And I think from a geopolitical standpoint, it was just stupid
because we're in an intense competition, a high-tech competition, a
security competition, economic competition with China. And these states
want to be aligned with the US and we are pushing them into China's
arms. And if we don't give them the ability to buy the American tech
stack, it's not like they're going to sit on their hands and do nothing.
They're going to be forced to buy the Chinese tech stack. They're going
to participate one way or the other, right? And China still has some
limitations on how many chips it can produce, but they clearly are
building their own Chinese tech stack. It's a Huawei plus Deepseek tech
stack. There's actually a story in Malaysia just in the last couple of
days where they were talking about building a local data center using
the Huawei Ascend GPU plus Deep Seek. And then they walk back that story
because I think they're afraid of getting in trouble with with the US
government. But the point is that if we drive these countries away, if
we alienate them, they will end up partnering with China instead of the
United States. I don't understand how that's in the United States's
interest. Now, as part of this trip, we rolled out a new framework for
an AI acceleration partnership with these countries. And there's a few
very important terms that I think it's worth going into. So, so first of
all, the the purpose of the framework is to replace the Biden export
control to the region with a framework that gives them the ability to
buy GPUs and build data centers. Uh, but there's a few very important
provisions. Number one is there's a matching investment provision. So,
for every dollar of investment they make in terms of building out data
centers in the region, they have to invest a dollar in the United States
and building out our AI infrastructure. So it's a huge win for the
United States in terms of accelerating our own infrastructure buildout.
So that's point number one. Number two is even with respect to the data
centers they're going to build in the region, at least 80% of the chips
have to be owned and operated by American cloud service providers or
American hyperscalers. So even with respect to the data centers they're
building, the vast majority of the compute is going to be run by
American companies. And so I mean this to me is just a huge...

\[中文翻译\]
我有同样的观察。所有这些国家的精英都在西方受过教育，通常是在美国，有些在英国。领导层往往年轻、有远见、面向未来，对人工智能非常感兴趣，就像我说的，他们想在人工智能领域做大事。阻碍他们的是，2023年10月，拜登政府基本上对整个地区获取半导体、GPU施加了全面限制，要求GPU或包含GPU的服务器的每一次出口都必须获得商务部的特定许可证。这极大地抑制了他们在该地区建立数据中心或发展本地人工智能的努力。所以，他们一直处于这种僵持状态，拜登政府决定疏远他们。而且，你知道，不仅仅是人工智能，还有其他事情。还记得那个碰拳吗？拜登政府对该地区的这些国家非常……我会说，怀有敌意、冷淡、不友好，甚至可以说是敌对。我认为从地缘政治的角度来看，这简直是愚蠢的，因为我们正与中国进行激烈的竞争，包括高科技竞争、安全竞争和经济竞争。而这些国家希望与美国结盟，我们却把他们推向中国的怀抱。如果我们不给他们购买美国技术栈的能力，他们不会坐以待毙。他们将被迫购买中国的技术栈。他们总会以某种方式参与进来，对吧？中国在芯片生产数量上仍有一些限制，但他们显然正在建立自己的中国技术栈。那是一个华为加深思考（Deepseek）的技术栈。实际上，过去几天在马来西亚就有一个故事，他们谈论使用华为昇腾（Ascend）GPU加深思考来建立本地数据中心。然后他们又撤回了这个说法，因为我想他们害怕惹上美国政府的麻烦。但关键是，如果我们赶走这些国家，如果我们疏远他们，他们最终会与中国而不是美国合作。我不明白这怎么符合美国的利益。现在，作为这次访问的一部分，我们推出了一个与这些国家建立人工智能加速伙伴关系的新框架。其中有一些非常重要的条款，我认为值得深入探讨。所以，首先，这个框架的目的是取代拜登政府对该地区的出口管制，建立一个让他们有能力购买GPU和建立数据中心的框架。但是，有一些非常重要的规定。第一，有一个匹配投资条款。也就是说，他们在该地区建立数据中心方面每投资一美元，就必须在美国投资一美元来建设我们的人工智能基础设施。因此，这对于加速美国自身基础设施建设来说是一个巨大的胜利。这是第一点。第二，即使是关于他们将在该地区建立的数据中心，至少80%的芯片必须由美国云服务提供商或美国超大规模计算公司拥有和运营。因此，即使是他们正在建立的数据中心，绝大多数计算也将由美国公司运行。所以，我的意思是，这对我们来说简直是一个巨大的……

JCal:

Was there critique were people critiquing it like uh you know this uh
expansion I guess Ro Khanna has said like hey we should build more data
centers here that was sort of a light critique maybe or a
misunderstanding that that Ro was making and Ro is a friend but just you
know I respond to him on on X which is we are building out data centers
in the US. We want to do as much as we can. It's the Trump
administration's policy towards energy that's making that possible.
We're making it easier to spin up new power generation and we're making
it easier to permit. Both both those things were virtually impossible
during the Biden administration. So we are building more here in the US.
In addition to that, you've got these countries who are resource-rich
and they have their own AI dreams and aspirations and we can either
partner with them or drive them into the arms of China. And the deal
we've made is to enable their aspirations while getting them to fund
more AI infrastructure in the United States and even the infrastructure
they're building over there. First of all, it's going to be on an
American tech stack, right? We want it to be Nvidia and AMD and those
types of companies. That improves our balance of trade. It also ensures
that these data centers across the world are going to be built on
American technology. We want American technology to become the standard
of course and if you allow those data centers to be built on Huawei plus
deepseek that will become the standard. So I think this is something
that people in Silicon Valley intuitively grasp but people in Washington
don't which is the way that you win these technology battles is you
create the largest ecosystem right you want to have the most partners
you want to have the biggest app store you want to have the API everyone
use the most data power exactly so the point is we want to involve the
whole world on our tech stack I think export controls on China that
makes sense but we don't want to reduce our market share in the rest of
the world we want them getting hooked on our platform platforms, making
those platforms the standard and getting lock in before China can catch
up to us.

\[中文翻译\]
有没有批评？人们是否在批评它，比如……你知道，这种扩张……我想罗·卡纳（Ro
Khanna）曾说过，嘿，我们应该在这里建更多的数据中心，那可能是一种轻微的批评，或者罗可能有所误解，罗是我的朋友，但你知道，我在X（推特）上回应了他，那就是我们正在美国建设数据中心。我们想尽我们所能。是特朗普政府的能源政策使这成为可能。我们正在让启动新的发电项目更容易，也让审批更容易。这两件事在拜登政府期间几乎是不可能的。所以我们正在美国建设更多。除此之外，这些国家资源丰富，他们有自己的人工智能梦想和抱负，我们可以与他们合作，或者把他们推向中国的怀抱。我们达成的协议是，在实现他们抱负的同时，让他们为美国更多的人工智能基础设施提供资金，甚至包括他们在那里建设的基础设施。首先，它将基于美国的技术栈，对吧？我们希望是英伟达、AMD这类公司。这改善了我们的贸易平衡。它还确保了世界各地的数据中心都将基于美国技术建造。我们当然希望美国技术成为标准，如果你允许那些数据中心基于华为加深思考（Deepseek）来建造，那它们就会成为标准。所以我认为这是硅谷人士凭直觉就能理解，但华盛顿人士却不理解的事情，那就是赢得这些技术战的方法是建立最大的生态系统，对吧？你希望拥有最多的合作伙伴，你希望拥有最大的应用商店，你希望拥有每个人都在使用的API，最多的数据能力，没错。所以关键是我们希望让全世界都参与到我们的技术栈中来。我认为对中国的出口管制是有道理的，但我们不希望减少我们在世界其他地区的市场份额，我们希望他们迷上我们的平台，让这些平台成为标准，并在中国赶上我们之前锁定他们。

David Sacks:

Sacks, did Jensen just say that he thought export controls were kind of
pointless? Did he just say that recently? Yeah, he he's against all
export controls. And you know where I would split the baby here is that
I think that most people in Washington believe that the export controls
on China make sense because we simply can't allow our most powerful
semiconductors to be to be used by China because of the dual use. Now,
where I agree with Jensen is that I think we should not place undue
restrictions on the rest of the world using the American tax stack
because we will simply concede the market share to China. And so I think
he's right with respect to the Middle East. Now the the other concern
that you heard a lot is around this quote diversion the idea that
somehow the GPUs or somehow the IP if we allow it to be used in data
centers in the Middle East will somehow find its way to China and yeah I
mean the expression on your face Jal shows that makes no sense like
these guys have unlimited resources they have unlimited ambition that's
just a naive point of view they want these for themselves they
understand the power of AI they don't want to give it to China they want
it for themselves pounds. They make trillions of dollars selling oil and
gas. They don't need to smuggle our GPUs. It doesn't make any sense. The
the other thing is that that people don't understand, you know, they're
called chips, but really these things are now the size of mainframes.
The NVIDIA data center product, NVL72, is this giant server cabinet.
It's 8 ft tall. It weighs 3600 lb. It's not like diamonds you smuggle in
a briefcase, right? All you have to do is send You're not putting them
up and getting them across the border. That's definitely not happening.
No, it's not happening. All you have to do is send an inspector to the
data center to count the servers and you can see that they're there.
Ridiculous. So this idea that somehow they're going to get smuggled.
It's like this totally fake concern that's been created. It's almost
like a totally fake narrative, you know. Then people, well, they won't
physically smuggle the servers, but the IP will somehow be transferred
to China. Look, there's nothing in a data center that China hasn't
already seen. They have one of at least one of everything. The issue is
that they can't reverse the advanced semiconductors just from the chips,
right? Because it's about the process technology that it takes to create
an advanced semiconductor. There's hundreds or even thousands of steps
in that process. And you can't figure out the recipe just by seeing the
end product.

\[中文翻译\] Sacks，黄仁勋（Jensen
Huang）刚才是不是说他认为出口管制有点毫无意义？他最近是这么说的吗？是的，他反对所有出口管制。你知道我会如何在这里取一个折衷的办法吗？我认为华盛顿的大多数人相信对中国的出口管制是有道理的，因为我们根本不能允许我们最强大的半导体被中国使用，因为它们具有军民两用性。现在，我同意黄仁勋的观点是，我认为我们不应该对世界其他国家使用美国技术栈施加不当限制，因为那样我们只会把市场份额让给中国。所以我认为他在中东问题上是对的。现在你经常听到的另一个担忧是所谓的“转移”问题，即如果允许在中东的数据中心使用GPU或知识产权，它们会以某种方式流向中国。是的，我的意思是，JCal，你脸上的表情表明这毫无道理。这些人拥有无限的资源，他们有无限的野心，那只是一个天真的观点。他们想要这些东西为自己所用，他们了解人工智能的力量，他们不想把它给中国，他们想要它为自己所用。他们通过出售石油和天然气赚取数万亿美元。他们不需要走私我们的GPU。这毫无意义。另一件事是人们不明白，你知道，它们被称为芯片，但实际上这些东西现在有大型计算机那么大。英伟达的数据中心产品NVL72是一个巨大的服务器机柜。它有8英尺高，重达3600磅。它不像你用公文包装运的钻石，对吧？你所要做的就是派……你不可能把它们藏起来运过边境。那绝对不可能发生。不，不会发生。你所要做的就是派一名检查员到数据中心清点服务器，你就能看到它们在那里。太荒谬了。所以这种认为它们会被走私的想法，就像一个完全虚构的担忧，一个几乎完全虚构的叙事，你知道吗。然后人们会说，好吧，他们不会物理走私服务器，但知识产权会以某种方式转移到中国。你看，数据中心里没有什么东西是中国没见过的。他们至少每样东西都有一个。问题在于，他们无法仅仅通过芯片来逆向工程先进的半导体，对吧？因为这关系到制造先进半导体所需的工艺技术。这个过程有数百甚至数千个步骤。你不可能仅仅通过看到最终产品就能弄清楚配方。

JCal:

I would like to say that I'm very proud of my bestie. I got three calls.
I do want to tell you, Sacks, you crushed it. I think you Yeah, it was
pretty impressive. put your best foot forward and people were really
impressed. But I got calls I got three calls from the powers at be. They
were very psyched to meet you and spend time with you and they thought
you were super impressive. So it was awesome. Thank you for doing that.

\[中文翻译\]
我想说，我为我的好兄弟感到非常骄傲。我接了三个电话。Sacks，我确实想告诉你，你做得太棒了。我认为你……是的，非常令人印象深刻。你展现了最好的一面，人们都印象深刻。但我接到了电话……我接到了三个来自当权者的电话。他们非常兴奋能见到你并与你共度时光，他们认为你超级令人印象深刻。所以这太棒了。谢谢你这样做。

David Sacks:

Well, I appreciate that. Yeah, it's an incredible region. I think you're
doing like a really patriotic thing. If you look at that region, like
you said, it could tip one way or the other. They could be involved with
the West. They we could be building businesses together. And if we build
businesses together, that's better than them building businesses with
China. Pretty obvious, I think. I mean, totally. And this is the thing
is I just don't get the opposition in Washington to this. And I
especially don't get how the opponents of this can call themselves China
hawks because at the end of the day, this is a tech battle between the
US and China. And we can have these countries be aligned with us and in
our orbit, or we could push them into the arms of the Chinese. The
choice is do we want these countries to be the piggy bank for American
AI or for Chinese AI? It's like say they have an investment level that
they can do that dwarfs anybody else in the world with the exception of
Norway and the United States. I mean they can put a lot of money to work
and here's the thing they want to.

\[中文翻译\]
嗯，我对此表示感谢。是的，那是一个令人难以置信的地区。我认为你正在做一件非常爱国的事情。如果你看看那个地区，就像你说的，它可能会倒向一方或另一方。他们可能与西方合作。我们可以在那里共同建立业务。如果我们共同建立业务，那比他们与中国建立业务要好。我认为这很明显。我的意思是，完全如此。问题就在这里，我只是不明白华盛顿方面对此的反对。我尤其不明白那些反对者怎么能自称是对华鹰派，因为归根结底，这是美国和中国之间的技术战。我们可以让这些国家与我们结盟，在我们的势力范围内，或者我们可以把他们推向中国的怀抱。选择在于，我们是希望这些国家成为美国人工智能的提款机，还是中国人工智能的提款机？就好像说，他们的投资水平可以使世界上任何其他国家（除了挪威和美国）都相形见绌。我的意思是，他们可以投入大量资金，而且关键是他们愿意这样做。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

It just hit the wire that OpenAI is partnering on a 5 gigawatt data
center cluster in Abu Dhabi with G42.

\[中文翻译\] 刚刚有消息称，OpenAI 正在与 G42 合作，在阿布扎比建设一个 5
吉瓦的数据中心集群。

David Sacks:

Well, let's hold on. Let's just be clear about so the the 5 gigawatt
cluster or it's more of a a campus that's going to support many American
hyperscalers and cloud service providers and they're going to be one of
the tenants. So, I think they're saying that they're going to have 1
gigawatt. There's still 4 gigawatts to go that they plan on supporting.

\[中文翻译\]
嗯，等等。让我们明确一下，这个5吉瓦的集群，或者更像是一个园区，将支持许多美国超大规模计算公司和云服务提供商，而他们将是租户之一。所以，我认为他们是说他们将拥有1吉瓦。还有4吉瓦是他们计划支持的。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

Well, well, the the the most interesting part of the deal it said was
that as part of the deal, G42 plans to make a reciprocal dollar
for-dollar investment in AI infrastructure in the US. So to your point,
Sacks, it's like perfect. Cooperating like this, I think just makes a
ton of sense.

\[中文翻译\] 嗯，嗯，协议中最有趣的部分是，作为协议的一部分，G42
计划在美国的人工智能基础设施中进行等额的对应投资。所以，Sacks，正如你所说，这简直太完美了。像这样的合作，我认为非常有意义。

Sacks:

Absolutely. And this is not dumb money, by the way. These are very smart
people who are investing very strategically with a very crisp, you know,
group of individuals, like you said, who have been educated in the west.
You know, when people explain to me, oh yeah, just go to Abu Dhabi and
come back with a a suitcase full of money. No, these are folks who want
to be on the board of companies. They want to company build. They see
themselves as owners in business, not just investors. And then they want
to do it domestically and abroad. The amount of investment that they're
going to do in the next 30 years is going to dwarf what we see out of
universities and retirement accounts. I don't people understand the
scale of what's happening. This is why I just don't understand the point
of the Biden policy of alienating these countries and making them feel
uneasy about their place because you you don't know who it was that made
the decision. Yeah, I mean, let's face it, that guy was confused. We can
have Bernies. I've actually have a pretty good idea at this point of who
was controlling the auto pen on AI. There was a group of of very
powerful staffers in the Biden administration, about half a dozen people
who kind of controlled AI policy. And the interesting thing is none of
them have ever worked in Silicon Valley. They're all basically lawyers.
And they don't really have a good understanding of the idea of a
platform or a technology ecosystem or a stack. And I don't think they
realized that by alienating these very resource-rich countries that they
were creating a huge opportunity for China to come in and serve the
region. And this is why I think this, you know, again, what I call AI
diplomacy is so important is it boxes out China. It's good for America.
It's good for our companies. It's good for our trade balance. It makes
us the standard and it boxes out China. What's not to like about this? I
really don't get it.

\[中文翻译\]
当然。顺便说一句，这可不是傻钱。这些人非常聪明，他们进行非常战略性的投资，拥有一群非常精干的……你知道，就像你说的，在西方受过教育的人。你知道，当人们向我解释说，哦是的，只要去阿布扎比，然后带着一箱子钱回来就行了。不，这些人是想进入公司董事会的。他们想建立公司。他们把自己看作是企业的所有者，而不仅仅是投资者。然后他们想在国内和国外都这样做。他们在未来30年将要进行的投资规模，将使我们从大学和退休账户中看到的投资相形见绌。我不认为人们理解正在发生的事情的规模。这就是为什么我就是不明白拜登政府疏远这些国家并让他们对自己的处境感到不安的政策的意义所在，因为你不知道是谁做出的这个决定。是的，我的意思是，让我们面对现实吧，那家伙糊涂了。我们可以有伯尼（Bernie
Sanders）那样的人。我现在对谁在控制人工智能的“自动笔”（指决策权）已经有了相当清晰的认识。拜登政府中有一群非常有权势的工作人员，大约有六个人，他们在某种程度上控制着人工智能政策。有趣的是，他们中没有一个人在硅谷工作过。他们基本上都是律师。他们对平台、技术生态系统或技术栈的概念并没有很好的理解。而且我不认为他们意识到，通过疏远这些资源非常丰富的国家，他们正在为中国进入并服务该地区创造一个巨大的机会。这就是为什么我认为，你知道，我再次强调，我称之为人工智能外交的事情如此重要，因为它排挤了中国。这对美国有好处。对我们的公司有好处。对我们的贸易平衡有好处。它使我们成为标准，并排挤了中国。这有什么不好的呢？我真的不明白。

JCal:

I you know I think they were living in a world where they put people
into very rigid buckets. If you wanted to look at human rights as an
issue, which I think is what some people were doing in that
administration, I look at the progress that's being made and if you go
to these societies and you look at what's happening in that region, the
pace at which human rights and individual freedoms is growing and the
rate at which those societies are moving forward, it's going in the
right direction. So what do we want to do? Do we want to steer people
towards collaboration and working together to build the future or do you
want to have it devolve? I mean, it's such a stupid decision by the
Biden administration.

\[中文翻译\] 你知道，我认为他们生活在一个把人 rigidly
划分为不同类别的世界里。如果你想把人权看作一个问题——我认为那届政府中的一些人就是这么做的——我会看看正在取得的进展，如果你去那些社会，看看那个地区正在发生什么，人权和个人自由增长的速度，以及那些社会前进的速度，它正朝着正确的方向发展。那么我们想做什么呢？我们是想引导人们走向合作，共同建设未来，还是想让它倒退？我的意思是，拜登政府的这个决定太愚蠢了。

Sacks:

It was perplexing. Yeah, I I really don't get it. I I don't understand
what the point of alienating these Gulf States was.

\[中文翻译\]
令人费解。是的，我真的不明白。我不明白疏远这些海湾国家的意义何在。

JCal:

Well, I like Trump's approach there when he said, "Listen, you're going
to make decisions in your own time." That's what they want to hear. They
want to be respected as they respect us. Hey, we're going to make
decisions in our own time what's right for our people. That's a process
that we'll decide. Now, if you want to collaborate on building a
company, a data center, a technology platform, hey, we're here for that,
but you can't tell us how to run our society and just like we wouldn't
want them to come here and tell us how to run our society, right? So I
agree with what you just said JCal and I thought the best part of the
president's speech which the whole thing was excellent but the best part
was when he talked about how the neocons and the interventionists had
come into the region and lectured people and come in with this very
moralistic point of view and made all these interventions that basically
wrecked countries and it's it wasn't the the neocon interventionists who
have led to so much progress in the Middle East and in the Arab world
it's been the countries themselves whose own leaders have set the the
path and have had the vision. That was an incredible speech. It was
incredible. Trump for me. Yeah, he did a great job. Credit do and that's
the message they've wanted to hear for a long time and that's the
message that moves society forward. All these other messages just sort
of set it back and um I think I'm I'm super hopeful about the region.

\[中文翻译\]
嗯，我喜欢特朗普在那里的做法，他说：“听着，你们会在自己的时机做出决定。”这正是他们想听到的。他们希望像我们尊重他们一样受到尊重。嘿，我们会在自己的时机决定什么对我们的人民是正确的。这是一个由我们决定的过程。现在，如果你想在建立公司、数据中心、技术平台方面合作，嘿，我们乐于奉陪，但你不能告诉我们如何管理我们的社会，就像我们不希望他们来这里告诉我们如何管理我们的社会一样，对吧？所以我同意你刚才说的，JCal，我认为总统演讲中最好的部分——整个演讲都很出色——但最好的部分是他谈到新保守主义者和干涉主义者如何进入该地区，教训人们，并带着这种非常道德化的观点进行各种干预，基本上摧毁了一些国家。而且，并不是新保守主义干涉主义者带来了中东和阿拉伯世界的巨大进步，而是这些国家自己，是他们自己的领导人规划了道路并拥有远见。那是一场令人难以置信的演讲。太不可思议了。对我来说是特朗普。是的，他做得很好。功不可没，这正是他们长期以来想听到的信息，也是推动社会前进的信息。所有其他信息都只是让事情倒退，而且……嗯……我认为我对这个地区充满希望。



## 科学角：CRISPR 基因编辑与能源问题

<div class="dialogue">

JCal:

Okay, let's do Science Corner. You know. Oh, by the way, I just I was
just checking um X here and it looks like there is a um announcement on
what the Open AI device is going to be. You guys see this? Here we go.
Oh, the puck. The little puck. I saw that puck, but it hasn't been
confirmed yet. Oh, it's a puck you put on your desk and it Yeah, it's
like a puck with a camera and a hole for a mic. Oh, that's a pin. Yeah,
that's a pendant. It's a pendant. I could have made 10 times straight up
versus a pendant. That's a puck. It fits in the palm of your hand. It's
too small to be a puck. A puck's like the size of your hand. It looks
like your thumb. Okay, this is AI generated. It's not actually the
device. They haven't shown the device from Jony Ive yet. Somebody just
took what's in the Wall Street Journal report. They mocked it up. This
is their best guess as to what it might look like. This is already out.
And by the way, this is going to get you punched in the face. You show
up with a listening device to a party or a meeting, I'm gonna knock you
out. This is ridiculous. And it's got a camera in it, too. I don't want
this surveillance device anywhere near me. How are you going to do it?
Like this? Yeah. Get that buck away from me. Yeah. Okay. Anytime you're
ready, how dare you record me and violate my privacy. I was literally at
dinner the other day. I kid you not. And somebody came up with one of
these things and it was clipped on his thing. I said, "Hey, uh, what's
the thing on your lapel?" He said, "It's an AI recording device. It
does. Uh, it summarizes what we're doing. I said, he goes, "Oh, do you
do you care?" I said, "Do you care if I punch you in the face for
covertly recording me?" And he said, "Yes." I said, "Well, then turn it
turn it off." I mean, literally, let's talk about science. Let's talk
about science. I mean, well, you raise a good point, JCal, that these um
these new devices... No, these new devices requires a level of trust
that is kind of unprecedented. Yeah, I mean you already had to trust,
you know, Google and iPhone and so on because they do have a huge level
of access to your data, but the new let's call them AI connected
devices. I mean they are surveillance devices. I mean their whole point
is to listen and see everything that you can hear and see and you know
and then to give that data to AI to do something with and um man you
better trust that company completely. Oh yeah. Which company's doing it?
Oh right, that company. Yeah. Hm. The company that had every leader
leave because they didn't trust the founder. Okay. All right. Yeah. Go
ahead and wear the puck. And by the way, with these pucks, I'm going to
make one more point, Freeberg. I'm sorry. These devices need to have a
red flashing diode on them when they're recording. We need to pass
legislation that it does that. If it's recording, it should have a
flashing red light on it.

\[中文翻译\]
好的，我们来做科学角。你知道的。哦，顺便说一下，我刚才在看X（推特），看起来有关于OpenAI设备是什么的公告。你们看到了吗？来了。哦，那个圆盘（puck）。那个小圆盘。我看到那个圆盘了，但还没确认。哦，是你放在桌上的一个圆盘，它……是的，像一个带摄像头和麦克风孔的圆盘。哦，那是个别针。是的，那是吊坠。是吊坠。我本来可以赌它不是吊坠，赔率十倍的。那是个圆盘。它能放在手掌里。它太小了，不像圆盘。圆盘有你手那么大。它看起来像你的拇指。好吧，这是AI生成的。它实际上不是那个设备。他们还没有展示
Jony Ive
设计的设备。有人只是根据《华尔街日报》的报道内容做了个模型。这是他们对它可能样子的最佳猜测。这个已经出来了。顺便说一句，这会让你挨揍的。你带着窃听设备去参加派对或会议，我一拳打晕你。这太荒谬了。而且它里面还有摄像头。我不想让这个监控设备靠近我。你打算怎么做？像这样？是的。把那玩意儿从我身边拿开。是的。好吧。随时准备好，你竟敢录我音，侵犯我的隐私。前几天我真的在吃晚饭。我不骗你。有人带着这么个东西过来，夹在他的衣服上。我说：“嘿，呃，你领子上那是什么？”他说：“这是个人工智能录音设备。它能……呃，它能总结我们正在做的事情。”我说，他说：“哦，你介意吗？”我说：“你介意我因为你偷偷录我音而揍你一顿吗？”他说：“介意。”我说：“好吧，那把它关掉。”我的意思是，说真的，我们来谈谈科学吧。我们来谈谈科学。我的意思是，嗯，JCal，你提出了一个很好的观点，这些……这些新设备……不，这些新设备需要前所未有的信任度。是的，我的意思是，你已经不得不信任，你知道的，谷歌和iPhone等等，因为它们确实对你的数据有很高的访问权限，但是这些新的……我们称之为AI连接设备。我的意思是它们是监控设备。我的意思是它们的全部目的就是聆听和看到你能听到和看到的一切，你知道，然后把这些数据交给AI来做些什么，而且……老兄，你最好完全信任那家公司。哦是的。是哪家公司在做？哦对了，是那家公司。是的。嗯。那家所有领导都因为不信任创始人而离开的公司。好吧。好吧。是的。去戴上那个圆盘吧。顺便说一句，关于这些圆盘，Freeberg，我想再补充一点。抱歉。这些设备在录音时需要有一个闪烁的红色二极管。我们需要通过立法来规定这一点。如果它在录音，就应该有一个闪烁的红灯。

JCal:

Let's go to Science Corner because everybody Chamath loves Science
Corner. Freeberg. Some breaking news, some uh innovations in Crisper.
Yes.

\[中文翻译\] 我们进入科学角吧，因为每个人……Chamath
喜欢科学角。Freeberg。一些突发新闻，一些关于CRISPR的创新。是的。

David Freeberg:

It's got a lot of press coverage, but there was a baby born named KJ in
the research paper that was published was born with a mutation that was
inherited from the mother on a specific gene called CPS-1. And the same
mutation inherited from the father, which resulted in the fact that this
gene has a deficiency in it. CPS1 produces a protein that's part of the
urea cycle. So basically breaking down nitrogen or protein compounds in
the blood so that they can be excreted. And in the absence of this
protein, if this protein is not being made in the body, ammonia
accumulates in the blood and that has extraordinarily harmful
consequences including brain damage and ultimately death. This gene had
a G that was mutated into an A on both of the copies of the gene meant
that the protein wasn't being correctly produced. And as a result, the
breakdown of nitrogen and ammonia was not possible. And so this leads to
a very short life for the very very very very few people that have ever
had this double mutation that this particular child was unfortunately
born with. So we have technology today, crisper gene editing technology.
In fact, crisper gene editing technology is what we use to do some of
the work we do at Oh, the company I run. And um some advanced forms of
gene editing technology include what are called base editors where you
can change a single letter on a strand of DNA into another letter. So in
this particular case, changing an A to a G was the goal. So the
physician Rebecca Arens Nicholas, giving her a big shout out for the
incredible work she did in partnership with scientists at the University
of Pennsylvania, they developed very quickly a very specific gene
editing target to go in and find the letter A and turn it to G in this
particular patient's body. Now remember, we have the same DNA in all of
our cells in our body, but specific cells have specific functions and
genes are expressed in only those cells. So in this case, it's the liver
that makes this this CPS1 protein. And so they had to get the gene
editing into the liver cells to edit the liver cells. And if they could
edit the liver cells, then those liver cells would start to become more
functional and you would have a functional protein. So they quickly
tested dozens of base editors. These are different proteins that can go
in and edit. They tested different guide RNAs. These are the guides that
tell that editing protein where to go, what part of the DNA to go to,
which is trying to get it to this exact same site. They tested it in
petri dishes. Then they tested it in mice, then in monkeys to make sure
that the selection that they came up with worked. They then put it in
the child. And so basically by putting it in the blood found its way
into the liver and that's the the the fortunate benefit here was at the
end of the day you're trying to edit specific cells and we can get to
the liver by putting the crisper and the guide into the blood. It made
its way to the liver and they coded the gene editing system with liquid
nanoparticles which helped it get into the cells. It got absorbed by the
liver. It got went into the cells. It found its way to the site on the
DNA. That's amazing. converted the A to G and as a result those liver
cells became functional to make the protein that breaks down the ammonia
in the child's blood. And so they did the first one just to make sure
the child would handle it. It worked. The child didn't have any adverse
effects. They then did the second dose, able to take the child off some
of the medicines and compounds they were giving the child to break down
ammonia in the blood and they gave it the third dose and they're
monitoring. So this is the first time that we've seen this kind of
custom crisper gene editing for a genetic mutation being applied to a
patient in vivo in the blood for a specific target for a specific
particular uh treatment.

\[中文翻译\]
这件事获得了很多媒体报道，但发表的研究论文中提到一个名叫KJ的婴儿，他出生时带有一种从母亲那里遗传的特定基因（名为CPS-1）突变。并且从父亲那里遗传了相同的突变，导致这个基因存在缺陷。CPS1产生一种蛋白质，是尿素循环的一部分。所以基本上是在血液中分解含氮化合物或蛋白质化合物，以便它们能够被排出体外。如果缺乏这种蛋白质，或者身体不产生这种蛋白质，氨就会在血液中积累，这会造成极其有害的后果，包括脑损伤并最终导致死亡。这个基因的两份拷贝上都有一个G突变成了A，这意味着蛋白质无法正确产生。结果，氮和氨的分解就不可能了。因此，对于极少数不幸携带这种双重突变的婴儿——就像这个特定的孩子一样——这会导致生命非常短暂。所以我们今天拥有CRISPR基因编辑技术。事实上，CRISPR基因编辑技术就是我们在我经营的公司（指The
Production
Board，Freeberg是其创始人）进行一些工作时使用的技术。一些先进的基因编辑技术包括所谓的碱基编辑器，它可以将DNA链上的单个字母改变成另一个字母。所以在这种特殊情况下，目标是将A变为G。因此，医生丽贝卡·阿伦斯·尼古拉斯（Rebecca
Arens
Nicholas）——为她与宾夕法尼亚大学科学家合作所做的不可思议的工作致以崇高敬意——他们非常迅速地开发出一种非常特异性的基因编辑靶点，进入这个特定患者体内找到字母A并将其变为G。现在记住，我们身体所有细胞中都有相同的DNA，但特定细胞有特定功能，基因只在那些细胞中表达。所以在这种情况下，是肝脏产生这种CPS1蛋白质。因此他们必须将基因编辑工具送入肝细胞以编辑肝细胞。如果他们能够编辑肝细胞，那么那些肝细胞就会开始变得更有功能性，你就会拥有功能性蛋白质。所以他们迅速测试了数十种碱基编辑器。这些是不同的可以进入并进行编辑的蛋白质。他们测试了不同的向导RNA（guide
RNAs）。这些向导RNA告诉编辑蛋白质去哪里，去DNA的哪个部分，试图将其引导到这个完全相同的位置。他们在培养皿中进行了测试。然后在小鼠身上测试，然后在猴子身上测试，以确保他们选择的方案有效。然后他们将其用于这个孩子。所以基本上通过将其注入血液，它找到了进入肝脏的途径，这里的幸运之处在于，最终你试图编辑的是特定细胞，而我们可以通过将CRISPR和向导RNA注入血液来到达肝脏。它到达了肝脏，他们用液体纳米颗粒包裹了基因编辑系统，这有助于它进入细胞。它被肝脏吸收，进入了细胞，找到了DNA上的靶点。这太神奇了。将A转换为G，结果那些肝细胞变得有功能，可以制造分解孩子血液中氨的蛋白质。所以他们先做了一次，以确保孩子能够承受。结果很好。孩子没有任何不良反应。然后他们进行了第二次给药，能够让孩子停用一些他们之前用来分解血液中氨的药物和化合物，然后他们进行了第三次给药，并正在监测。所以这是我们第一次看到这种针对特定遗传突变的定制CRISPR基因编辑技术，通过血液在体内应用于患者，针对特定靶点进行特定治疗。

JCal:

I just asked Grok how many diseases are because of an A to G point
mutation and it says it's hard to estimate through the human genome
database or ClinVar but it estimated between 20 and 30,000 conditions
are because of an A to G point mutation and isn't that incredible? Yeah.
And I'll tell you one other story about this. I saw a geneticist here at
UCSF a couple years ago and he was telling me about all of these kids
that come in and they don't know what's wrong with them and he can see
on the kid's face. He can see a disease condition. They have all these
weird lab tests and the kids are dying or they're really deficient in
some way and they can't afford to do the DNA sequencing because the
child is on Medi-Cal or some other sort of like healthcare plan and it
costs like \$5,000 to do the DNA sequencing needed to figure out what
genetic mutation this particular child has. So there aren't easy
off-the-shelf targeted tests or lab tests you can run to figure out when
people have genetic disease. And so this is a an incredible like
undiscovered set of problems. Chamath to your point that there are
likely millions of people out there that have some health condition that
they've not yet been able to identify because it's a genetic mutation
and not everyone can afford to go out and just get their genome sequence
to figure out where the mutation might lie in their body. And so as we
discover more and more genetic mutations, we build targeted tests for
identifying that people have them and hopefully over time can start to
build more targeted therapies like this one to go after and make the
changes at specific sites to fix the the genetic mutations. Bad ass.
It's incredible.

\[中文翻译\]
我刚问了Grok（AI模型），有多少疾病是由A到G的点突变引起的，它说很难通过人类基因组数据库或ClinVar来估计，但它估计有2万到3万种疾病是由A到G的点突变引起的，这难道不令人难以置信吗？是的。我再给你们讲一个关于这个的故事。几年前我在加州大学旧金山分校（UCSF）见过一位遗传学家，他告诉我有很多孩子来看病，他们不知道自己得了什么病，但他能从孩子的脸上看出来。他能看出一种疾病状况。他们做了各种奇怪的实验室检查，孩子们正在死去，或者他们在某些方面非常欠缺，但他们负担不起DNA测序的费用，因为孩子参加的是Medi-Cal（加州医疗补助计划）或其他类似的医疗保健计划，而进行DNA测序以找出这个特定孩子有什么基因突变需要花费大约5000美元。所以没有简单易得的现成靶向测试或实验室测试可以用来确定人们何时患有遗传病。因此，这是一系列令人难以置信的、尚未被发现的问题。Chamath，正如你所说，可能有数百万人的健康状况尚未被确定，因为那是基因突变，而且不是每个人都能负担得起进行全基因组测序来找出突变可能存在于他们身体的哪个部位。因此，随着我们发现越来越多的基因突变，我们为识别这些突变建立了靶向测试，并希望随着时间的推移，能够开始建立更多像这样的靶向疗法，去针对特定位点进行改变，以修复基因突变。太厉害了。太不可思议了。

Sacks:

Okay, somebody wake Sacks up. Sacks, just so you know, one thing about
America is we've got a pretty good advantage in gene editing technology
today. And China is on its way coming after the US on this technology
front as well as AI. You woke him up. You should peak his interest.
China's coming for Uranus. And you will see some very good posts
recently on people talking about how a lot of technology that's been
developed in the United States is being transferred to China. and they
are building biotech companies and biotech solutions that take American
IP and put them into market and this has also had a very big dampening
effect on the biotech market. So what do you think we should do about
that? It should be in the trade negotiations some tighter IP controls.

\[中文翻译\] 好了，谁来把 Sacks
叫醒。Sacks，只是想让你知道，关于美国的一件事是，我们今天在基因编辑技术方面拥有相当大的优势。而中国正在这项技术以及人工智能领域追赶美国。你把他叫醒了。你应该激起他的兴趣。中国正瞄准你的“天王星”（Uranus，此处双关，也指“你的屁股”）。你最近会看到一些很好的帖子，人们在谈论很多在美国开发的技术正在被转移到中国。他们正在建立生物技术公司和生物技术解决方案，利用美国的知识产权并将其推向市场，这也对生物技术市场产生了非常大的抑制作用。那么你认为我们应该对此做些什么呢？应该在贸易谈判中加入一些更严格的知识产权控制。

Chamath Palihapitiya:

I can tell you Sacks that a very large company I had a conversation with
their CEO and they said this exact thing which is that the amount of IP
that's available for purchase or for licensing questionable provenance
but how effective and good it is is causing them to figure out how to
establish more of a presence to just buy stuff there. It's kind of like
so what does that mean? Meaning that let's just say you have an R&D
effort in the United States. you can almost hedge your bets by having an
outpost in or near China, let's say Hong Kong, where there's an
equivalent project for almost anything that we're working on happening
there at the same time in real time. And so if you can't figure out how
to get it here, you can get it there and it's much murkier and the the
laws are sort of unclear and it's just different enough where you can
kind of get to the same place. So it's just to say what Freeberg said,
which is that the amount of R&D that the Chinese are doing is roughly
equivalent to the amount of R&D that the United States is doing. Yeah.
And so as a result, everything that we discover, they discover. And so
it really is a foot race. And we're kind of neck and neck.

\[中文翻译\]
Sacks，我可以告诉你，我曾与一家非常大的公司的CEO交谈过，他们说的正是这件事，那就是可供购买或许可的知识产权数量——其来源可疑，但其有效性和质量如何——正促使他们考虑如何在当地建立更多的业务据点来直接购买。这有点像……那是什么意思呢？意思是，比方说你在美国有一个研发项目，你几乎可以通过在中国或中国附近（比如香港）设立一个前哨基地来对冲风险，在那里，几乎我们正在进行的任何项目都有一个等效的项目在实时同步进行。所以，如果你在这里弄不到，你可以在那里弄到，而且那里的情况要模糊得多，法律也不太明确，而且差异也足够大，以至于你基本上可以达到同样的目的。所以这只是想说
Freeberg
所说的，那就是中国正在进行的研发投入量与美国正在进行的研发投入量大致相当。是的。因此，结果就是，我们发现的一切，他们也会发现。所以这真的是一场赛跑。我们现在可以说是并驾齐驱。

David Freeberg:

For sure. This is a perfect time to make sure that we have an
electricity deficit. Perfect time.

\[中文翻译\] 当然。现在是确保我们出现电力短缺的绝佳时机。绝佳时机。

Sacks:

Well, I agree with you. We need to build out power, but I think the
administration's committed to doing that. Drill, baby, drill.

\[中文翻译\]
嗯，我同意你的看法。我们需要建设电力，但我认为政府致力于这样做。“钻探，宝贝，钻探！”（意指大力发展石油等能源）

Chamath Palihapitiya:

I'm not questioning Trump's desire. I'm talking about the actual
congressional bill details.

\[中文翻译\] 我不是在质疑特朗普的愿望。我说的是国会法案的实际细节。

JCal:

I saw yesterday the Tennessee Valley Authority filed the first ever
application for a small modular reactor. Let's go. Hopefully, it gets
approved very quickly. This is, by the way, I I I will watch this. I
think others should watch this to see how quickly they're able to get
through the regulatory process to get that thing approved. And that will
be a very good indicator if it gets approved and they can get fast
permitting, fast deployment. That would be an incredible insight on how
quickly the US will be able to scale power production for AI over under
2032.

\[中文翻译\]
我昨天看到田纳西河流域管理局提交了有史以来第一个小型模块化反应堆的申请。加油！希望它能很快获得批准。顺便说一下，我会关注这件事。我认为其他人也应该关注，看看他们能以多快的速度通过监管程序获得批准。如果获得批准并且能够快速获得许可、快速部署，那将是一个非常好的指标，可以了解美国在2032年之前能够以多快的速度扩大人工智能的电力生产规模。

David Sacks:

What exactly? Let's do a poly market. Great. Let's do a poly market and
let's you should create a special Trump designation like a speedrun
designation. When something's super important, he puts the speedrun
designation on it and they they actually attempt to do it as fast as
possible.

\[中文翻译\] 具体是什么？我们来搞个 Poly
Market（预测市场）。太好了。我们搞个 Poly
Market，而且你（JCal）应该创建一个特殊的特朗普指定，比如“速通”（speedrun）指定。当某件事超级重要时，他就给它贴上速通指定，然后他们就真的会尝试尽可能快地完成它。

JCal:

I don't know if you guys watched my interview with Burgum, but he said
that there's a permit for a copper mine that's been outstanding for 30
years. They've been trying to get through the permitting process. 30
years to get this copper mine started to run. And now he and the team
are trying to fasttrack this thing. But 30 years it's been sitting
through a...

\[中文翻译\]
我不知道你们看没看我对伯格姆（Burgum）的采访，但他说有一个铜矿的许可证已经拖了30年了。他们一直在努力通过审批程序。花了30年才让这个铜矿开始运营。现在他和他的团队正试图快速推进这件事。但30年来，它一直卡在一个……

Chamath Palihapitiya:

Here's the good news. The Manilla folder has made its way down the
elevator. So, it's down there in the sub basement, soon to be shipped.
But let's go ahead and get rid of Doge. Let's get rid of Doge and keep
things...

\[中文翻译\]
好消息是，那个马尼拉文件夹已经乘电梯下来了。所以，它现在在地下室的底层，很快就要运走了。但是，我们还是先摆脱
D.O.G.E. 吧。让我们摆脱 D.O.G.E.，然后保持……

David Freeberg:

Well, I don't want to get rid of Doge, but let me ask you a very
question. No, I'm joking. I'm like, yeah, I know. Given the amazing
advances that you see coming with crisper, biotech, but also AI,
robotics, what are the odds that we can grow our way out of this fiscal
problem? Yeah. Yeah. I do I I I'll be honest. I think the limiting fac
so the crisper side is going to have profound effects in longevity,
human health, and food abundance. So those are I think about abundance
in four ways. One is abundance of food or calories. One is in abundance
of labor through automation. One is in abundance of lifespan or
longevity. And one is an abundance of what I think is the most important
and gating factor which is energy which leads to everything else. So you
can't have the labor savings without the energy and the productivity
improvements without the energy. So the thing I do watch the most,
Sacks, and that I do think you and I have talked about this that I do
think is the critical lynch pin for all of those other points of
abundance being unleashed is the energy equation. And this is where I
look very clearly and plainly at what China's doing versus what where
we're at today. We've got stated intentions, but the actions are where
we're still, you know, we got to start showing up. That's it. But let's
assume that we have enough power. I mean, my point's really about Yeah.
If we have enough power, the 38 trillion of debt doesn't matter. Really?
You you're saying that in a No, I'm very very serious way. That's a
pretty that's a pretty important conclusion because if that's true and
we can grow our way out of this problem, then that's an alternative to
having this austerity approach where there's for which there's no
political, you know, will.

\[中文翻译\] 嗯，我不想摆脱
D.O.G.E.，但让我问你一个非常重要的问题。不，我开玩笑的。我就像，是的，我知道。考虑到你看到的CRISPR、生物技术，以及人工智能、机器人技术的惊人进展，我们通过增长摆脱这个财政问题的几率有多大？是的。是的。我……我……老实说。我认为限制因素……所以CRISPR方面将在长寿、人类健康和食物丰裕方面产生深远影响。所以我认为丰裕有四个方面。一是食物或卡路里的丰裕。二是通过自动化实现劳动力的丰裕。三是寿命或长寿的丰裕。还有一个我认为是最重要和起决定性作用的因素，那就是能源，它导致了其他一切。所以没有能源就不可能有劳动力节约，没有能源就不可能有生产力的提高。所以，Sacks，我最关注的事情，而且我认为你和我也讨论过这个问题，我认为对于释放所有其他丰裕点来说，关键的症结在于能源方程式。这就是我非常清晰、坦率地看待中国正在做的事情与我们今天所处位置的对比。我们有明确的意图，但在行动方面，我们仍然……你知道，我们必须开始有所作为。就是这样。但假设我们有足够的电力。我的意思是，我的观点实际上是关于……是的。如果我们有足够的电力，那38万亿美元的债务就不重要了。真的吗？你是……你是认真的吗？不，我非常非常认真。那是一个相当……那是一个相当重要的结论，因为如果那是真的，而且我们可以通过增长摆脱这个问题，那么这就是一种替代紧缩政策的方法，而紧缩政策缺乏政治意愿。

Sacks:

Sacks listen. If I saw us adding a terawatt of electricity production
capacity per year in the US, I would shut the up about the debt. I
wouldn't care. terawatt. We're talking about gigawatts. Yeah, I'm
talking about one terawatt. No, I know. But I'm saying I'm like chi
China, you guys know China right now is dealing in in gigawatts. Yeah, I
know. Have a terawatt and China is dealing in terowatts. China is
moving. I mean, we've been through the numbers, but they're going to
they're adding an entire United States every 18 months. Every 18 months.
Yeah. So, every 18 months, China adds all of the power production
