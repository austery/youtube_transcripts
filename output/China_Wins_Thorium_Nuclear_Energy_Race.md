# 中国如何赢得钍核能竞赛

讲述者：Cold Fusion

## 引言：钍核能的曙光

Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion. In the quiet deserts of
China's Gansu Province, something extraordinary just happened. What's
claimed to be the world's first operational thorium reactor has come to
life. And what makes this extra remarkable is that they did it all using
declassified American research. It's an incredible story.

你好，欢迎来到新一期的《冷聚变》。在中国甘肃省宁静的沙漠中，刚刚发生了一件非同寻常的事情。据称是世界上第一座可运行的钍反应堆已经投入使用。更值得注意的是，他们完全是利用解密的美国研究成果完成的。这是一个令人难以置信的故事。

For decades, thorium has been whispered about as the holy grail of
nuclear energy. It's meant to be cleaner, safer, and almost impossible
to weaponize. In fact, 5 years ago on this very channel, I explored the
theory of thorium in one of my videos. But today, it's a reality.

几十年来，钍一直被誉为核能的“圣杯”。它被认为更清洁、更安全，且几乎无法被武器化。事实上，五年前就在这个频道，我在一期视频中探讨了钍的理论。但如今，它已成为现实。

But this isn't just a scientific milestone. It's a glimpse into a future
where energy innovation isn't driven by profit, but by public
investment. And it shows what happens when we decide to bet on long-term
research for a payoff in the order of half a century. In this episode,
we dig deep into the big picture of a better, safer nuclear energy
called thorium reactors. We'll also try to separate the hype from the
reality. If the Chinese test proves successful and scalable, could this
prove to be a turning point in the history of energy production, or is
it not all it's cracked up to be?

这不仅仅是一个科学里程碑，它也让我们窥见了一个未来——能源创新不再由利润驱动，而是由公共投资推动。它展示了当我们决定为了一项长达半个世纪回报的长期研究进行投入时，会发生什么。在本期节目中，我们将深入探讨钍反应堆这一更好、更安全的核能的宏大前景，同时我们也将努力区分其中的炒作与现实。如果中国的试验被证明是成功且可扩展的，这会成为能源生产史上的一个转折点吗？还是说它并非像宣传的那样完美？

## 钍的巨大潜力

5,000 tons of thorium would supply the planet with all of its energy for
a year. So your one mine would bring up enough thorium without even
trying to power the entire planet. It's found in tailings piles. It's
found in ash piles. We could use thorium about 200 times more
efficiently than we're using uranium now. This reduces the waste
generated over uranium by factors of hundreds and by factors of millions
over fossil fuels.

五千吨的钍足以供应地球一年的全部能源。因此，仅仅一个矿场就能在不经意间开采出足够为整个地球供电的钍。它存在于尾矿堆和灰烬堆中。我们利用钍的效率可以比现在利用铀高出约200倍。这将使核废料的产生量比铀减少数百倍，比化石燃料减少数百万倍。

But before we get started, just some quick housekeeping. Cold Fusion
episodes are now available on Spotify, so you can watch them there if
you prefer.

在我们开始之前，先说一些简短的事务。Cold
Fusion的节目现在也可以在Spotify上观看，如果你喜欢，可以选择在那里收看。

## 为何需要钍？传统能源的困境

Since the industrial revolution, we've had to burn fossil fuels to turn
on our lights, cook our food, and power our lives. It works, but the
downside is serious air pollution, billions of dollars in healthcare
expenses, and millions of preventable deaths. And then in the wake of
World War II came the nuclear age. Nuclear power was different. It was
amazingly efficient and seemed like the future. But over time, there
were problems with its public image and fears of nuclear disaster. Enter
thorium. Thorium appears to be the perfect solution. It's abundant. It's
less volatile and less reactive than uranium. And a nuclear plant
powered by thorium can't suffer from a nuclear meltdown. In the Chinese
reactor, for instance, if things do get out of hand, a plug at the
bottom of the reactor melts automatically. The fuel then simply drains
out using gravity. A much better scenario than the unstoppable chain
reaction of traditional reactors.

自工业革命以来，我们不得不燃烧化石燃料来点亮灯光、烹饪食物和驱动我们的生活。这种方式行之有效，但其弊端是严重的空气污染、数十亿美元的医疗开支以及数百万可预防的死亡。随后，在第二次世界大战之后，核能时代到来了。核能与众不同，它效率惊人，似乎代表着未来。但随着时间的推移，其公众形象出现了问题，人们对核灾难的恐惧与日俱增。于是，钍进入了人们的视野。钍似乎是完美的解决方案。它储量丰富，比铀的挥发性和反应性都低。而且，由钍驱动的核电站不会发生核熔毁。例如，在中国的反应堆中，一旦情况失控，反应堆底部的一个塞子会自动熔化，燃料会利用重力自动排出。这比传统反应堆中无法控制的链式反应要安全得多。

For added context, to give you a picture of just how efficient thorium
reactors are, just look at this chart. It shows the ratio of energy out
to energy in. The purple bar is a thorium molten salt reactor and the
blue bar next to it is a traditional nuclear reactor. If thorium is
proved successful, it's clear to see why it's world-changing stuff,
especially when compared to any previous form of energy production.

为了让您更直观地了解钍反应堆的效率，请看这张图表。它展示了能量输出与能量输入的比率。紫色条代表钍基熔盐反应堆，旁边的蓝色条代表传统核反应堆。如果钍技术被证明是成功的，那么它改变世界的潜力是显而易见的，特别是与任何以往的能源生产形式相比。

## 中国的突破与美国的遗产

Despite thorium's immense potential compared to hundreds of uranium
based nuclear reactors, they remain as mythical as a unicorn. There's
only one operational thorium reactor and it's hidden away in the Gobi
Desert. China may possess the world's sole reactor, but the twist is it
was built on American research.

尽管与数百座基于铀的核反应堆相比，钍具有巨大的潜力，但它们仍然像独角兽一样神秘。世界上只有一个正在运行的钍反应堆，它隐藏在戈壁沙漠中。中国可能拥有世界上唯一的钍反应堆，但有趣的是，它是建立在美国的研究基础之上的。

We're all at Oak Ridge. The morning that we showed up, one of the Oak
Ridge guys came in with an announcement from the Chinese Academy of
Science. We are going to do this. We're going to own the IP. So, you
would think someone in our government would say, "Maybe you shouldn't
keep giving away this information."

我们都在橡树岭。我们到达的那天早上，橡树岭的一位工作人员带来了一份来自中国科学院的公告。他们宣称：“我们将要实现这个目标，我们将拥有这项知识产权。”
所以，你可能会想，我们政府里应该有人会说：“或许你们不应该再继续泄露这些信息了。”

The Chinese achievement was announced by head of the thorium reactor
project, Xu Hongjie, during a closed door meeting at the Chinese Academy
of Science. He stated, quote, "The US left its research publicly
available, waiting for the right successor. We were that successor. We
mastered every technique in the literature, then pushed it further. We
are now at the frontier of global nuclear innovation." End quote.

钍反应堆项目负责人徐洪杰在中国科学院的一次闭门会议上宣布了中国的这一成就。他表示：“美国将其研究公之于众，等待着合适的继承者。我们就是那个继承者。我们掌握了文献中的每一项技术，并将其进一步推进。我们现在正处于全球核创新的前沿。”

## 钍反应堆的工作原理

So, okay, let's back up a bit and learn what a thorium reactor actually
is. Firstly, thorium is a naturally occurring element found in rock
deposits. It serves as the fuel for the reactor. When thorium is hit
with neutrons, it absorbs instead of splitting, eventually turning into
a fissile material, uranium-233.

好的，让我们回过头来，了解一下什么是钍反应堆。首先，钍是一种在岩石矿床中发现的天然元素，用作反应堆的燃料。当钍被中子轰击时，它会吸收中子而不是分裂，最终转变为一种可裂变材料——铀-233
(Uranium-233)。

A fissile material is one that splits apart when neutrons are blasted at
the atoms. When this happens, energy is released that can then be
converted into electricity, usually by heating steam and driving a
turbine. Unlike uranium, the naturally occurring thorium-232 is not
fissile, meaning it cannot sustain a nuclear reaction on its own.
However, it is fertile, so it can be transformed into a fissile
material, but it needs a helping hand getting there.

可裂变材料 (Fissile material)
是指当中子轰击其原子时会发生分裂的材料。当分裂发生时，能量被释放出来，这些能量可以被转换成电能，通常是通过加热蒸汽来驱动涡轮机。与铀不同，自然界中的钍-232是不可裂变的，这意味着它无法自行维持核反应。然而，它是可增殖的，可以转化为可裂变材料，但这需要一些外部帮助。

For thorium to become a useful fuel source, it first has to be blasted
with neutrons, turning it into thorium-233, which beta decays into
protactinium-233. The protactinium can be extracted, which decays into
uranium-233, a usable fuel.

为了使钍成为有用的燃料来源，它首先必须被中子轰击，转化为钍-233。钍-233经过β衰变
(beta decay：原子核自发地放出β粒子或俘获一个轨道电子而发生的转变)
变成镤-233
(protactinium-233)。然后可以提取出镤，它会衰变成可用的燃料——铀-233。

There really were three options for nuclear energy at the dawn of the
nuclear era. There was uranium-235, which was the fissile form of
uranium. This was the form of uranium that could actually be utilized
directly in a nuclear reactor. Most of the uranium was uranium-238. This
had to be transformed into another nuclear fuel called plutonium before
it could be used. And then there was thorium. And in a similar manner to
uranium-238, it also had to be transformed into another nuclear fuel,
uranium-233, before it could be used in a reactor.

在核能时代初期，实际上有三种核能选择。第一种是铀-235，它是铀的可裂变形式，可以直接在核反应堆中利用。大部分的铀是铀-238，它必须先转化为另一种核燃料——钚，然后才能使用。第三种是钍。与铀-238类似，它也必须先转化为另一种核燃料——铀-233，才能在反应堆中使用。

Now, this process doesn't work well with traditional nuclear reactors
because they use solid fuel rods and pressurized water cooling. It's
much harder to extract things mid-reaction when fuel is in solid form.
Enter molten salt reactors. The molten salt fuel for this reactor is
radically different from that used in solid fuel reactors. Here, salt
flows from a pipe which is heated to keep the salt molten. At 1200°F
(649°C), the salt does not react with air. It flows like water, but does
not boil.

然而，这个过程在传统的、使用固体燃料棒和加压水冷却的核反应堆中效果不佳。当燃料是固体形式时，在反应中途提取物质要困难得多。于是，熔盐反应堆
(Molten Salt Reactors)
应运而生。这种反应堆的熔盐燃料与固体燃料反应堆所用的燃料截然不同。在这里，盐从管道中流出，并通过加热保持熔融状态。在1200华氏度（约649摄氏度）下，盐不与空气发生反应。它像水一样流动，但不会沸腾。

To recap, molten salt reactors use liquid fuel, which makes it much
easier to isolate protactinium and continue the thorium fuel cycle. If
done right, molten salt reactors can be way safer than the standard
water-cooled reactors, the latter of which must be kept under insanely
high pressures to stop the water from boiling away. Molten salt reactors
can operate at low pressure and, as mentioned, are set up in a way that
in the case of an emergency, the fuel is automatically drained away,
avoiding the chance of this happening.

总结一下，熔盐反应堆使用液体燃料，这使得分离镤和持续进行钍燃料循环变得更加容易。如果操作得当，熔盐反应堆比标准的水冷反应堆要安全得多，后者必须保持在极高的压力下以防止水沸腾。熔盐反应堆可以在低压下运行，并且如前所述，其设计方式使得在紧急情况下燃料可以自动排出，从而避免了核事故的发生。

## 钍能源的四大优势

Despite not being a ready-to-use fuel and requiring complex processing,
if done right, thorium could be a superior alternative to uranium for
four reasons. Number one, it's abundant. Thorium is everywhere. It's in
the Earth's crust, in rocks, and it's at least three times more abundant
than uranium. In China alone, there's enough thorium reserves to power
the country's energy needs for the next 20,000 years.

尽管钍不是一种即用型燃料，需要复杂的处理过程，但如果操作得当，它可能成为优于铀的替代品，原因有四。第一，储量丰富。钍无处不在，存在于地壳、岩石中，其储量至少是铀的三倍。仅在中国，钍的储量就足以满足该国未来20000年的能源需求。

Number two, it's safer. As I mentioned earlier, thorium itself isn't
fissile. And while that sounds like a downside, it can actually be a
good thing. It grants more control over the reaction. Some pro-thorium
advocates also emphasize that thorium is "proliferation-resistant",
meaning that you can't easily make bombs with it. But others say that
these safety claims are exaggerated, just as the risks of nuclear
reactors are. But also, because of the reactor design, the use of molten
salt as a coolant eliminates the need for high-pressure water systems
like traditional designs, reducing the risk of accidents like a steam
explosion.

第二，更安全。如前所述，钍本身不可裂变。虽然这听起来像个缺点，但实际上可能是好事，因为它能更好地控制反应。一些钍的支持者还强调，钍具有“防扩散性”
(Proliferation-resistant)，意味着它不易被用于制造核弹。但也有人认为，这些安全声明被夸大了，就像核反应堆的风险一样。此外，由于反应堆的设计，使用熔盐作为冷却剂，无需像传统设计那样使用高压水系统，从而降低了蒸汽爆炸等事故的风险。

Number three, it's cleaner. Thorium reactors also don't emit greenhouse
gases and unlike uranium waste, which remains hazardous for tens of
thousands of years. Thorium waste becomes safe in just a few hundred
years. In the case of China, obtaining thorium could come at almost zero
effort. Surprisingly, thorium is actually a waste product of its rare
earth mining industry. We can power our civilization on thorium without
opening a single thorium mine. It is already a plentiful byproduct of
existing mining operations。

第三，更清洁。钍反应堆不排放温室气体。与铀废料需要数万年才能变得安全不同，钍废料仅需几百年即可。对中国而言，获取钍几乎不费吹灰之力。令人惊讶的是，钍实际上是中国稀土开采业的废弃物。我们可以在不开采任何钍矿的情况下，利用钍为我们的文明提供动力，因为它已经是现有采矿作业中丰富的副产品。

Number four, it's efficient. Thorium generates up to 200 times more
energy than uranium. To put it into context, just say you have two
batteries, one is uranium and one thorium. If the uranium battery gives
you 1 day of power, a thorium battery of the same size would power you
for 6.5 months.

第四，效率高。钍产生的能量是铀的200倍。打个比方，假设你有两块电池，一块是铀电池，一块是钍电池。如果铀电池能提供一天的电力，那么同样大小的钍电池可以为你供电6.5个月。

## 被搁置的美国研究

Despite all of this, molten salt reactors have largely been stuck in the
experimental phase for decades. Why aren't we working on liquid fuel in
the United States in general? Oh, licensing. Licensing a liquid fuel
reactor, especially a commercial one in the US right now, is scary. The
nuclear status quo remained unchallenged. Not even after countless
reactor meltdowns. No one's made any moves to put the molten salt
reactor theory into practice until now.

尽管如此，熔盐反应堆在很大程度上几十年来一直停留在实验阶段。为什么我们美国总体上没有致力于液体燃料的研究？哦，是许可证问题。为液体燃料反应堆，尤其是在美国商业化的反应堆申请许可证，目前来看是件令人望而生畏的事。核能领域的现状一直未受挑战，即使在发生无数次反应堆熔毁事故后也是如此。直到现在，才有人采取行动将熔盐反应堆的理论付诸实践。

Over in China, Xu and his team developed the reactor technology from
American declassified research of the 1960s. The US was testing this
very same technology, but chose not to develop it further. Instead, they
focused on uranium-fueled pressurized water reactor technology. That
1960s research was known as Oak Ridge. It was the closest America came
to thorium power. But why did they stop?

在中国，徐和他的团队从20世纪60年代美国解密的研究中发展了反应堆技术。当时美国正在测试完全相同的技术，但选择不再进一步发展，而是专注于铀燃料加压水反应堆技术。那项60年代的研究被称为“橡树岭”项目
(Oak Ridge National
Laboratory)。那是美国最接近钍能源的一次。但他们为什么停下了？

NRC regulations specifically spell out prohibitions against fluid fuel
reactors. You cannot operate a fluid fuel reactor more than 1 megawatt
without an expensive licensed process. After the Hiroshima bomb tipped
the scales of power in America's favor, the US was keen to develop more
nuclear weapons. Much of that work happened at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory in Tennessee. Director Alvin Weinberg also began looking into
alternative, less weaponizable nuclear methods. Thorium-fueled molten
salt reactors were what he settled on. The molten salt reactor
experiment ran from 1965 to 1969. The results were incredibly promising.
It quickly became the holy grail of thorium research. As the Bulletin of
Atomic Scientists states, quote, "All molten salt reactors are based in
one way or another on the molten salt reactor experiment that operated
at Oak Ridge from 1965 to 1969."

美国核管理委员会（NRC）的法规明确禁止使用流体燃料反应堆。在没有经过昂贵的许可程序的情况下，不能运行超过1兆瓦的流体燃料反应堆。在广岛原子弹使力量天平向美国倾斜后，美国急于发展更多核武器。大部分工作在田纳西州的橡树岭国家实验室
(Oak Ridge National Laboratory)
进行。主任阿尔文·温伯格也开始研究其他不易武器化的核方法，他最终选择了钍燃料熔盐反应堆。熔盐反应堆实验从1965年持续到1969年，结果非常喜人。它迅速成为钍研究的圣杯。正如《原子科学家公报》所述：“所有熔盐反应堆都或多或少地基于1965年至1969年在橡树岭运行的熔盐反应堆实验。”

Following the vision of Alvin Weinberg, he was the director of Oak Ridge
National Labs from the '50s to the 1970s, and he had a vision of how we
could use thorium to advance beyond the current constraints of our
society in terms of fossil fuels, hydro power and existing nuclear
technology. One of the amazing parts about his vision was how this could
transform not only the US economy but many other places in the world,
some of which don't have the resources that we have in terms of fresh
water or arable land. This is a vision he had of how thorium reactors
could be used to desalinate water, grow crops in desert areas to really
truly change the economic balance of the world. But then the experiment
was shut down. In his book, Alvin Weinberg questioned, quote, "Why
didn't the molten salt system, so elegant and so well-thought out,
prevail? There were no technical reasons why the molten salt reactor was
not pursued."

阿尔文·温伯格是橡树岭国家实验室从50年代到70年代的主任，他有一个愿景，即如何利用钍来超越我们社会在化石燃料、水力发电和现有核技术方面的限制。他愿景中一个惊人的部分是，这不仅可以改变美国经济，还可以改变世界上许多其他地方，其中一些地方在淡水或可耕地方面没有我们拥有的资源。他设想，钍反应堆可以用于海水淡化，在沙漠地区种植作物，从而真正改变世界的经济平衡。但后来，这个实验被关闭了。阿尔文·温伯格在他的书中质问：“为什么熔盐系统，如此优雅和深思熟虑，没有成功？并没有技术上的原因导致熔盐反应堆没有被继续研究。”

For one, during the Cold War, uranium fever was at an all-time high. The
Pentagon needed faster breeder reactors that could fuel the nuclear arms
race. In short, nobody cared that thorium was safer or that it wasn't
suitable for weaponry. That somewhat defeated the point. Weinberg's
vision, on the other hand, was brought to an end in the early 1970s. And
I think this was a very sad moment in the history of our country and
probably in the history of the world because an entire direction of
potential development was being ended at that moment by a not
well-thought-out comment by Congressman Holifield, who was very
powerful. So Weinberg's pursuit of thorium appears to have had a great
deal to do with why he was fired from his position.

一方面，在冷战期间，对铀的狂热达到了顶峰。五角大楼需要更快的增殖反应堆来助长核军备竞赛。简而言之，没有人关心钍是否更安全，或者它不适合用于武器。这在某种程度上违背了初衷。另一方面，温伯格的愿景在20世纪70年代初被终结了。我认为这是我们国家乃至世界历史上一个非常可悲的时刻，因为一个充满潜力的发展方向，在那个时候被一位非常有权势的国会议员霍利菲尔德一个欠缺考虑的评论所终结。因此，温伯格对钍的追求似乎与他被解雇有很大关系。

It wasn't all about politics, though. According to Alvin, in the 1950s
and 60s, nuclear power was dominated by physicists who thought in terms
of solid fuel pins, reactor physics, and neutron behavior. All the
while, the key to safer nuclear power lay in chemistry. Quote, "Our
problem is not that the idea is poor, it's that it's different from the
mainstream and too chemical to be fully appreciated by non-chemists."

然而，这并不仅仅是政治问题。根据阿尔文的说法，在20世纪50和60年代，核能领域由物理学家主导，他们习惯于从固体燃料棒、反应堆物理学和中子行为的角度思考问题。而与此同时，实现更安全核能的关键在于化学。他曾说：“我们的问题不在于这个想法不好，而在于它与主流不同，并且化学属性太强，以至于非化学家无法完全理解其价值。”

## 中国的后来居上

So, the Oak Ridge experiment was defunded. Alvin was reassigned and the
Thorium blueprints gathered dust. That was until the 2000s. At that
time, NASA engineer Kirk Sorenson was researching ways to power a
community on the moon. Kirk stumbled across Oak Ridge's research on
molten salt reactors and thorium, and he was mesmerized by thorium's
energy density. It was so high that you could theoretically hold a
lifetime's worth of energy in your hand, and it was abundant on both the
Earth and on the moon. Kirk got to work to get the message out about
thorium. He was convinced that if the United States hadn't abandoned
thorium research, the country could have been energy independent by the
early 2000s.

于是，橡树岭实验的资金被切断，阿尔文被调任，钍反应堆的蓝图也从此蒙尘。直到21世纪初，情况才有所改变。当时，美国国家航空航天局（NASA）的工程师柯克·索伦森正在研究为月球社区供电的方法。柯克偶然发现了橡树岭关于熔盐反应堆和钍的研究，并为钍的能量密度所着迷。它的能量密度如此之高，以至于理论上你可以将一生的能量握在手中，而且它在地球和月球上都储量丰富。柯克开始着手宣传钍的优势。他坚信，如果美国没有放弃钍的研究，到21世纪初，国家本可以实现能源独立。

But alas, his thorium enthusiasm fell on deaf ears. But here, the story
takes a major turn. While seemingly everyone was ignoring what he had to
say, one country did notice the potential. China. There were thousands
of reports sitting there in public archives with insights that could
shape the next generation of energy. And the Chinese researchers
realized that a thorium-fueled molten salt reactor could solve their
growing energy needs and also secure their national interests. In 2009,
China's thorium project formally took shape. Construction began in 2018.
There were hundreds of scientists who worked day and night for years
dissecting declassified American documents, replicating experiments and
designing new materials. And many of them were on site for more than 300
days per year. Project lead would summarize the situation by saying,
quote, "Rabbits sometimes make mistakes and grow lazy. That's when the
tortoise seizes its chance and sees the chance they did."

然而，他对钍的热情并未得到重视。但故事在这里发生了重大转折。当似乎所有人都对他所说的话置若罔闻时，一个国家注意到了其潜力——中国。公共档案中有数千份报告，其中蕴含的见解可以塑造下一代能源。中国研究人员意识到，钍燃料熔盐反应堆可以解决他们日益增长的能源需求，并保障国家利益。2009年，中国的钍项目正式启动。建设于2018年开始。数百名科学家夜以继日地工作了多年，分析解密的美国文件，复制实验并设计新材料。他们中的许多人每年在现场工作超过300天。项目负责人曾这样总结情况：“兔子有时会犯错和变得懒惰，那时乌龟就抓住了机会，而他们确实抓住了机会。”

In 2023, China's Thorium molten salt reactor achieved a sustained
nuclear chain reaction. And by June of 2024, the reactor was
operational.

2023年，中国的钍基熔盐反应堆实现了持续的核链式反应。到2024年6月，该反应堆已投入运行。

## 现实检验：挑战与展望

And now we come to the reality check. We may be closer than ever before
to a thorium-powered future, but there are still many things to
consider. Contrary to popular belief, there have been a number of
commercial thorium plants in the past. And that's since the late 40s in
Germany, India, the Netherlands, and the US. But none of them survived
past the 1980s. Well, why is that? Some plants did have design problems,
but there's more to it. It turns out that the process of extracting
thorium from ore and converting it into a fertile fuel for nuclear
purposes was a lot more expensive than doing the same thing for uranium.
The pessimist view is that economics killed thorium and nothing else.

现在，我们来审视一下现实。我们可能比以往任何时候都更接近一个由钍驱动的未来，但仍有许多问题需要考虑。与普遍看法相反，过去曾有过一些商业化的钍工厂，自20世纪40年代末以来，在德国、印度、荷兰和美国都曾有过。但没有一个能存活到20世纪80年代以后。这是为什么呢？一些工厂确实存在设计问题，但原因不止于此。事实证明，从矿石中提取钍并将其转化为核燃料的过程，比对铀进行同样处理要昂贵得多。悲观的观点认为，是经济因素扼杀了钍，别无其他。

As mentioned, thorium can produce 200 times the energy of the equivalent
uranium. But this requires the reprocessing of the fuel. You can't just
run the plant and burn up all the thorium. And that's because as the
plant would keep running, at some point the accumulation of waste
products affects the operation of a thorium core. And as you guessed it,
to keep this up and keep the plant running long-term is expensive.

如前所述，钍可以产生相当于同等量铀200倍的能量，但这需要对燃料进行再处理。你不能简单地运行工厂并烧掉所有的钍。这是因为随着工厂持续运行，废物的累积会在某个时刻影响钍核心的运行。正如你所猜测的，要维持这种状态并让工厂长期运行是昂贵的。

And another clarification, a lot of people do say that the reason that
thorium hasn't caught on was that it can't be used for weapons, but it's
more along the lines that it's more expensive to use it as a weapon,
which is a good thing in the end, I guess. And then there's the problem
of material science. For molten salt reactors, the salt is extremely hot
and ends up being corrosive to its surroundings. Materials that can
survive this long term are hard to come by, but the Chinese seem to be
working on the issue. They've built a custom alloy called Hastelloy N.
So, let's say that thorium can do what the thorium proponents say it
can. Nations could power entire cities. There'd literally be no need for
fossil fuels, expensive and short-lived wind turbines, or even solar
panels that degrade over time.

另外需要澄清的是，很多人说钍未能普及的原因是它不能用于制造武器，但更准确的说法是，将其用作武器的成本更高，这最终或许是件好事。此外，还有材料科学的问题。对于熔盐反应堆，熔盐温度极高，最终会对周围环境产生腐蚀。能够长期承受这种环境的材料很难找到，但中国人似乎正在解决这个问题。他们已经制造出一种名为哈氏N合金
(Hastelloy N)
的定制合金。那么，假设钍能如其支持者所说的那样发挥作用，国家将能够为整个城市供电。届时，我们将不再需要化石燃料、昂贵且寿命短的风力涡轮机，甚至会随时间退化的太阳能电池板。

Plus, since molten salt reactors don't need water cooling, they could
run in deserts or even space. Thorium is also common on the moon and
easy to find. Here's an actual map of where the lunar thorium is
located. Thorium has an electromagnetic signature that makes it easy to
find even from a spacecraft. With the energy generated from a liquid
fluoride thorium reactor, we could recycle all of the air, water, and
waste products within the lunar community. In fact, doing so would be an
absolute requirement for success.

此外，由于熔盐反应堆不需要水冷却，它们可以在沙漠甚至太空中运行。钍在月球上也很常见且容易找到。这是一张月球钍分布的实际地图。钍具有电磁特征，即使从航天器上也很容易发现。利用液态氟化钍反应堆产生的能量，我们可以回收月球社区内的所有空气、水和废物。事实上，这样做是成功的绝对必要条件。

Thorium critics say that a lot of the promising claims are
oversimplified, and the road to thorium will be a real long slug. China
has made some serious moves, but it's still early days. Case in point,
the Chinese test reactor is actually tiny and it's not a full-fledged
power plant. It's rated for 2 megawatts of heat. For context, MIT's
research reactor on campus, a regular nuclear reactor, although the
biggest campus reactor in the US, is three times that size. But there's
also plans for a 60-megawatt Chinese reactor to be operational by 2030.

钍的批评者认为，许多充满希望的说法过于简单化，通往钍能源的道路将是一场漫长而艰苦的斗争。中国已经采取了一些重要举措，但仍处于早期阶段。例如，中国的测试反应堆实际上非常小，并非一个成熟的发电厂。其额定热功率为2兆瓦。作为参考，麻省理工学院校园内的研究反应堆——一个常规核反应堆，虽然是美国最大的校园反应堆——其规模是其三倍。但中国也计划在2030年前建成一个60兆瓦的反应堆并投入运行。

The Chinese scientists pulled off a world first. They added fresh fuel
to the thorium reactor while it was running. That proved that continuous
operation is possible and soon China may not be alone. Copenhagen
Atomics plans to test a molten salt thorium reactor in Switzerland in
2026. After this, they plan to mass manufacture them at scale. Other
countries are moving but at a slower pace. India, which has the world's
largest thorium reserves, have been researching thorium for ages but
refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and that slowed
progress. There's multiple startups in the US that are trying to revive
the molten salt reactor development. And there's other startups in other
countries, but most of this development remains mostly on paper.

中国科学家实现了世界首创。他们在钍反应堆运行时添加了新燃料，证明了连续运行是可能的。很快，中国可能不再是唯一的参与者。哥本哈根原子能公司计划于2026年在瑞士测试一个熔盐钍反应堆，之后计划大规模生产。其他国家也在行动，但步伐较慢。拥有世界最大钍储量的印度，多年来一直在研究钍，但因拒绝签署《核不扩散条约》而进展缓慢。美国有多家初创公司正试图恢复熔盐反应堆的开发。其他国家也有类似初创公司，但大部分发展仍主要停留在纸面上。

## 结论

But even if it is early days, it's encouraging that people are trying.
The thorium story shows the power of public research and how past R&D
can seed waves of innovation decades later. But it also shows how easily
research momentum can stall. As Xu Hongjie put it, quote, to achieve
something meaningful in this field, you must have perseverance and be
prepared to dedicate 20 to 30 years to one single pursuit. End quote.
So, there's red-hot views on either side of the thorium debate. Is it
the clean revolution of the future, or do we cut our potential losses
and stick with what we know? That is the question.

尽管尚处早期，但人们的尝试令人鼓舞。钍的故事展示了公共研究的力量，以及过去的研发如何在几十年后播下创新的种子。但它也揭示了研究势头是多么容易停滞。正如徐洪杰所说：“要在这个领域取得有意义的成就，你必须有毅力，并准备好为一项事业奉献20到30年。”
因此，在钍的辩论中，双方都有激烈的观点。它究竟是未来的清洁能源革命，还是我们应该及时止损，坚持我们已知的东西？这便是问题所在。
