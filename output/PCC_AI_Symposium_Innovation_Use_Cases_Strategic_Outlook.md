# AI研讨会纪要：创新、应用案例与战略展望

## 主题演讲对话：AI的紧迫性与机遇

### 领导力要务：学会取舍，聚焦未来

**Dave Wessinger:** And my two major investors in Dragoneer and Hillman
& Friedman spend more time trying to get me connected with every single
person that's moving well, or better or differently in AI, so I can
learn from that. It's a massive learning journey, and every day could be
spent with yet another company understanding their journey. And they
tend to connect me with ones that have had some reasonable success.

**Dave Wessinger:**
我的两大主要投资者——Dragoneer（一家专注于科技领域的成长型股权投资公司）和Hellman
&
Friedman（一家全球领先的私募股权投资公司），他们花了大量时间，试图让我与每一位在AI领域做得好、做得更好或做得与众不同的人建立联系，以便我能从中学习。这是一段巨大的学习旅程，每天都可以花在了解另一家公司的发展历程上。他们倾向于把我介绍给那些已经取得一定成功的公司。

**Dave Wessinger:** I'll just speak to one that's actually connected to
healthcare. This is a little more financial, but do have some healthcare
customers, and then I'll talk about a healthcare company. The one that I
saw was… It's a really interesting concept, and I think as I talk about
other organizations. I'm largely talking about solutions they deliver to
the market as the priority, but invariably, I think when we think about
what might be delivered to a market. In our own rights, our internal
stuff, we're consuming others' solutions. So it's the same thing, just
upside down.

**Dave Wessinger:**
我先谈一家与医疗健康相关的公司。这家公司更偏向金融领域，但确实有一些医疗客户，之后我再谈一家纯粹的医疗公司。我看到的那家公司有一个非常有趣的概念。当我谈论其他组织时，我主要关注的是他们向市场提供的解决方案，但反过来想，当我们考虑自己向市场提供什么时，我们内部也在消费他人的解决方案。所以这其实是同一件事，只是视角不同。

**Dave Wessinger:** And the thing that they've done well, as an
organization, they struggled to deliver AI to the market. I think what I
recognize the challenge with, they at least iterated, was… They're
moving really well in AI now, in the end market. Their revenue doubled
year over year. They acquired an AI company, accelerated some of their
work, and they basically have been building agents for the last 6
months. And driving a ton of opportunity into the business. And so they
sell it, it's an orchestration layer for their customers. They
productionized it versus give their end customers an opportunity to
build their own agents. And they've done extremely well, and I think
doubling revenue in a given year is pretty incredible, actually. In
terms of an outcome. So that's really positive.

**Dave Wessinger:**
他们做得很好的一点是，作为一个组织，他们最初在向市场交付AI方面遇到了困难。我认识到他们面临的挑战，但他们至少进行了迭代……现在他们在终端市场的AI领域发展得非常好，收入实现了同比翻倍。他们收购了一家AI公司，加速了部分工作，并在过去六个月里，他们基本上一直在构建“代理”（Agent:
指能够自主或半自主地执行任务、与环境交互并做出决策的AI系统。）。这为业务带来了大量机会。他们销售的是一个为其客户服务的“编排层”（Orchestration
Layer:
一种技术架构，用于协调和管理多个独立的AI代理或服务，使它们能够协同工作。），他们将其产品化，而不是让终端客户自己去构建代理。他们做得非常出色，我认为在一年内收入翻倍，这个成果相当惊人。所以这是非常积极的。

**Dave Wessinger:** The one takeaway for me there was. He had challenged
his own team, really smart, capable people. To move with agents and
build it themselves. And he gave them a certain amount of time before he
had to go outside and acquire it, and basically they got. They weren't
able to get to the point where you thought they could have, and so he
had to acquire. And I guess my takeaway from that is no more than. If
we're not taking time to sharpen the saw and learn and grow, we're gonna
be always caught up with the problems of the day and the priorities of
what's gonna pull us back. And I think getting focused on where we need
to go is a lot of courage from leadership, is a lot of courage from all
of us. And I think it's not what you say yes to, it's what you say no
to.

**Dave Wessinger:**
我从中得到的一个启示是，他曾挑战自己的团队——那些非常聪明、有能力的人——去开发并自己构建这些代理。他给了他们一定的时间，如果完不成，他就不得不向外寻求收购。结果是，他们没能达到预期的目标，所以他最终只能选择收购。我从中得到的启示就是：如果我们不花时间“磨刀”，去学习和成长，我们就会永远被日常问题和那些拖后腿的优先事项所困。我认为，要专注于我们需要前进的方向，需要领导层巨大的勇气，也需要我们所有人的勇气。关键不在于你对什么说“是”，而在于你对什么说“不”。

**Dave Wessinger:** And I think the one thing we hear around this
organization a lot. Is there's a lot of priorities, and the priorities
come down to leadership. And if we're not really clear with where we
need to go, what we need to choose, we're not gonna make that progress.
No matter how much learning we do today. We need to create space, and
that's gonna be hard, and it's gonna be hard to stomach sometimes,
because that will deviate from our current plans.

**Dave Wessinger:**
在我们这个组织里，我们经常听到的一件事就是：优先事项太多，而这些优先事项最终取决于领导层。如果我们不清楚前进的方向，不清楚该做什么选择，我们就无法取得进步，无论我们今天学了多少。我们需要创造空间，这会很困难，有时甚至难以接受，因为它会偏离我们现有的计划。

### 外部创新：从生态系统中学习

**Dave Wessinger:** The other one is, and this is a little bit external,
talking to some companies that are leveraging AI to drive their growth
in healthcare. And one example was, there's a company that has built an
orchestration layer on top of our application, that does two things.
One, gives end users an ability to automate all of their manual
processes. So they call it agents… Agent Operating Procedures. And
they're building a ton of them, on top of our application.

**Dave Wessinger:**
另一个例子是关于外部的，我与一些在医疗健康领域利用AI驱动增长的公司进行了交流。其中一个例子是，有一家公司在我们的应用程序之上构建了一个编排层，它能做两件事。第一，让终端用户能够自动化他们所有的手动流程。他们称之为“代理操作程序”（Agent
Operating Procedures），并且他们正在我们的应用之上大量构建这些程序。

**Dave Wessinger:** So what's interesting out of that is it's not
human-centered design. It's machine-centered design. Kind of
interesting. Kind of moving away from that. And then where they've taken
some opportunity, they've gone and they've created Chrome extensions on
top of our app to create a side-by-side workflow where customers can
create a lot of intelligence in this Chrome extension on top of our
application. So what's… And they're making really nice progress, kind
of… Let's say, to some extent, pre-revenue, but starting to take off,
because it's obviously solving a big problem.

**Dave Wessinger:**
有趣的是，这不再是“以人为中心的设计”，而是“以机器为中心的设计”。这很有意思，算是一种转变。他们抓住的另一个机会是，创建了基于我们应用的Chrome浏览器扩展，从而创造了一种并行的工作流，客户可以在这个扩展中创建大量智能功能。他们取得了非常好的进展，虽然在某种程度上还处于营收前阶段，但已经开始起飞，因为它显然解决了一个大问题。

### 董事会的呼声：AI的紧迫感

**Dave Wessinger:** And if it's not clear in every boardroom, the ask is
more AI, more AI, more AI, and so if somebody's solving that, and it's
not us, that could be problematic, and so it does drive you to a sense
of urgency and pace to start to deliver on that need. So, two different
examples of companies leveraging more of an AI. One wasn't AI-native,
and the other one is.

**Dave Wessinger:**
如果说每个董事会传达的信息还不够清晰的话，那就是：需要更多的AI，更多的AI，更多的AI。所以，如果有人正在解决这个问题，而那个人不是我们，这就会很成问题。这确实会驱动你产生一种紧迫感，并加快步伐去满足这种需求。所以，这是两个不同的例子，展示了公司如何利用AI。一个不是AI原生公司，另一个则是。

**Dave Wessinger:** And then the question is, you know, how do you
compete against that, and how do you think about that?

**Dave Wessinger:** 那么问题就来了，你如何与之竞争？你如何看待这个问题？

### 内部挑战：整合碎片化的AI解决方案

**Dave Wessinger:** And then internally, think about this for a moment.
We're trying to deliver to our customers AI-powered solutions is where
we would like to be. Our vendors internally that you deal with, Alan,
are trying to deliver AI to us, and they tend to be in their segments,
so whether it's finance, or sales, or product, or or services, or
otherwise. But we have to put Humpty Dumpty together in some way, shape,
or form to deliver a seamless experience and process for our own
employees, so….

**Dave Wessinger:**
然后从内部来看，思考一下这个问题。我们努力的方向是为客户提供AI驱动的解决方案。而Alan，你所接触的那些内部供应商，他们也​​在试图向我们交付AI，并且这些AI通常局限于各自的领域，比如财务、销售、产品或服务等。但我们必须设法将这些零散的部分整合起来，为我们自己的员工提供无缝的体验和流程。

**Dave Wessinger:** It's kind of hard to think about single-source AI
vendors. And that's why things like Copilot or orchestration layers take
off, is because they do go across so many different applications and
drive a ton of efficiency in the business, so….

**Dave Wessinger:**
很难想象只依赖单一来源的AI供应商。这就是为什么像Copilot或编排层这样的工具能够成功，因为它们能够跨越众多不同的应用程序，为业务带来效率提升。

**Dave Wessinger:** There's just a few examples that, uh, have kind of
a… It does drive a sense of urgency in terms of the… These things aren't
just… we're not just talking about them in theory, they're real. They're
starting to impact businesses. And its material. So I think it's an
opportunity internally, but also externally. One doesn't go without the
other.

**Dave Wessinger:**
这些例子确实带来了紧迫感。这些事情并非理论空谈，它们是真实存在的，已经开始对商业产生实质性影响。所以我认为，这既是内部的机遇，也是外部的机遇，两者相辅相成。

**Alan Missen:** Yeah, those are great examples, Dave. I think your
point around, sort of. You know, committed time to learn, right? And
that sort of ruthless prioritization. The combination of those two, I
think, is a very powerful comment that we really need to take seriously
on the back end of today, frankly. I think it's a great point, well
made。

**Alan Missen:**
是的，这些例子很棒，Dave。你提到的关于投入时间去学习，以及那种果断的优先级排序，我认为这两者的结合是一个非常有力的观点。坦率地说，这是我们今天会后需要认真对待的。这个观点提得非常好。

### 设计思维的变革：从人本到AI协同

**Dave Wessinger:** Alan, let me ask you a question as we're kind of
going back and forth. We, as everybody here knows, or should know, we've
had a meaningful effort around P2C. And as you think about what we're
doing design-wise, business process engineering or business process
modeling. Is a lot around how humans use a solution, and we think about,
you know, Salesforce or other components that might be in there, and
NetSuite. How do you think about AI as it relates to designing
differently. For the things that we traditionally would focus on, how
does a human do X, and how do we make it better? How do you think
differently about using agents, or thinking differently about AI in just
re-engineering the process?

**Dave Wessinger:**
Alan，在我们交流的过程中，我想问你一个问题。大家都知道，或者应该知道，我们在P2C（Product-to-Cash，从产品到现金的业务流程）项目上付出了巨大的努力。从设计的角度来看，我们所做的业务流程工程或建模，很大程度上是围绕着人类如何使用一个解决方案来展开的，比如我们考虑Salesforce或NetSuite等系统。那么，对于那些我们传统上关注于“人如何做某事以及如何做得更好”的领域，你如何看待AI带来的设计思维转变？你如何以不同的方式思考使用AI代理，或者在流程再造中以不同的视角看待AI？

**Alan Missen:** An area we're evolving… we're trying to evolve quite…
quite quickly, Dave. I think… If we look at, sort of, the traditional
way to build… to deliver those big transformational projects, you're
right, you sort of scope it, you build it, you test it, you go live. And
we're sort of two-thirds of the way down that journey, and all of a
sudden, there's a capability available to us that wasn't when we started
the project. So right now, we are sort of actively looking at, are there
3 or 4 areas within P2C. That we can start leveraging this right away.
It's not just about this new idea that's down the road that we'll go
tackle. It's like, we've got stuff that is in flight.

**Alan Missen:**
我们如何开始思考立即应用它？一个很好的例子是——我想我们在SLT（Senior
Leadership
Team，高层领导团队）会议上展示过，而且我知道你对此充满热情——我们能否让一个AI代理在11月上线时为客户生成报价？我们能把它准备好吗？我们正在这方面进行突破。我认为在财务后端，还有三四个类似的应用代理的想法，我们也在尝试，看能否同样在11月1日之前实现。这有点让人紧张，因为我们这等于是在“边飞边造飞机”，在项目进行中改变范围。

### 变革的速度：以月计年

**Dave Wessinger:** Very good. Yeah, it's exciting. Your point is very
interesting in that… You know, the advancements in 6 months, never mind
24 hours. Are just… it's unsettling how… the pace of change, and I think
Mike talked about a 5-year time horizon. Um, you know, disruption of the
cloud really took 10-plus years. Disruption here is… Barely measured in
years. I mean, two, three years out, what we see today as normal is
gonna be… It's gonna feel like it was 50 years ago history. It's pretty
incredible.

**Dave Wessinger:**
非常好。是的，这很令人兴奋。你的观点很有趣，在于……你知道，短短6个月内的进步，更不用说24小时了，其变化速度令人不安。我想Mike提到了一个5年的时间范围。要知道，云计算带来的颠覆花了十年以上的时间。而这里的颠覆……几乎不能以年为单位来衡量。我的意思是，两三年后，我们今天视为常态的东西……会感觉像是50年前的历史。这相当不可思议。

**Alan Missen:** Yeah. And I think the other comment you made, which is
really interesting, is some of the stuff that you're seeing around, sort
of, the bigger platforms, it's like the attack vector. For some of the
innovations, actually, kind of on the edges, right? It's not necessarily
sort of the… always the big players who are coming at you, it's the
small, innovative. Company that's sort of hitting it around the edges of
what sort of we're doing, and that's… that's really an interesting.
Dynamic for us to wrap our head around.

**Alan Missen:**
是的。而且你提到的另一点也很有趣，就是你看到的那些围绕大型平台的创新，它们的攻击向量实际上往往在边缘地带。发起攻击的不一定总是那些大公司，而是一些小而创新的公司，它们在我们业务的边缘进行冲击。这对我们来说，是一个需要去理解的、非常有趣的动态。

**Alan Missen:** And then the other comment you made around, sort of.
How are the vendors in our space, our platform partners, how are they
playing? Um, there's a data point that's… there's a data point that
suggests right now. 80% of applications software plays. Will have AI
capabilities embedded in them by next year. So, wrapping your head
around sort of the rationalizations of which ones are good, which ones
can be integrated, which ones should we use. I think, you know, it's…
you're right, every… every vendor's knocking on our door right now,
going, you need to look at our stuff.

**Alan Missen:**
你还提到了我们这个领域的供应商和平台合作伙伴，他们的策略是怎样的。有一个数据点显示，到明年，80%的应用软件将嵌入AI功能。所以，要理清哪些是好的，哪些可以集成，我们应该使用哪些，这确实是个挑战。你说得对，现在每个供应商都在敲我们的门，说“你们得看看我们的东西”。

### 经济驱动力：企业价值与AI授权

**Dave Wessinger:** Let me share with you the why behind that. And it
really starts with, if you think about enterprise value, is kind of a
key driver for a lot of folks. You sit in a boardroom, and you talk to…
We had this conversation of, you know. What if we do well, or what if we
do poorly? Let's just play out kind of a few scenarios. Um, and if… if
we do poorly, we could be half the value today. Six months from now.
Half of our value. What's the difference if we do it well? We have
AI-powered solutions showing up on market, demonstrating real revenue as
it related to it, and we would do significantly better than kind of a…
what our… what our shareholder value could look like.

**Dave Wessinger:**
让我告诉你这背后的原因。这真的始于企业价值，它是很多人的一个关键驱动因素。你坐在董事会里，和人讨论……我们有过这样的对话：如果我们做得好会怎样？如果我们做得差又会怎样？让我们设想几个情景。如果我们做得不好，六个月后，我们的价值可能会只有现在的一半。只有一半的价值。如果我们做得好，区别是什么？我们将拥有AI驱动的解决方案进入市场，展示出与之相关的真实收入，我们的表现将远远好于……我们股东价值的潜在水平。

**Dave Wessinger:** And so if you just think about the economics and why
you're seeing vendors show up saying, buy our AI-powered stuff, buy more
of that, because their entire enterprise value is based on their ability
to demonstrate they're capable of doing that. And so, that's why it's so
important for customers, us, other businesses, to kind of move into this
new world. It's an existential threat to the value of their business.
And so, yeah, people are pretty motivated.

**Dave Wessinger:**
所以，如果你从经济学的角度思考，就能明白为什么供应商们纷纷上门，说“买我们的AI产品吧，多买点”，因为他们整个企业的价值都建立在能否证明自己具备这种能力之上。因此，对于客户、我们以及其他企业来说，进入这个新世界至关重要。这对他们业务的价值构成了生存威胁。所以，是的，人们的动力都非常足。

**Alan Missen:** The assign interesting data point the other day on… to
your point around, sort of, valuation, and at the end of 24. Ai
organizations were kind of valued at about… I think the valuation was
something like \$450 billion. And it's expected in the next 6 years to
get to \$18 trillion. It's like a 37 or 40% CAGR. Year over year over
year, so it's exactly to your point, it's insane, the expectation.

**Alan Missen:**
前几天有一个关于估值的有趣数据点……正如你所说，在2024年底，AI组织的总估值大约是4500亿美元。预计在未来6年内，这个数字将达到18万亿美元。这相当于年复合增长率（CAGR:
Compound Annual Growth
Rate）达到37%或40%。年复一年，正如你所说，这种预期简直是疯狂的。

**Dave Wessinger:** Well, I'll give you a very specific data point. Two
companies recently acquired, one with two people. North of \$100
million. Two people. Another company, Israeli company, acquired for
multiple hundreds of millions of dollars, probably 30 or 40 people.
Neither company had any revenue. No revenue. Like, that's the appetite
for AI-based companies. It's incredible. And so….

**Dave Wessinger:**
我给你一个非常具体的数据点。最近有两家公司被收购，其中一家只有两个人，收购价超过1亿美元。就两个人。另一家是以色列公司，大约三四十人，以数亿美元的价格被收购。这两家公司都没有任何收入。零收入。这就是市场对AI公司的渴望程度。这太不可思议了。

**Dave Wessinger:** It's absolutely incredible. It reminds me of the
days where I wish SaaS companies back in 2002 were actually doing that.
They were in 99 before it all blew up. Um, but yeah, it's just a, uh,
it's clear… it's interesting, and I kind of… I look in the mirror, I'm
like, holy shit, I'm old. I'm gonna catch the second wave. Like, the
first one was cloud, I'm gonna be around for another one, I can share
stories. It's like… I'm kind of excited to write the next paper to
Forbes about what it's like to go through two major disruptions in a
lifetime.

**Dave Wessinger:**
这绝对是令人难以置信的。这让我想起了2002年，我多希望那时的SaaS（Software
as a
Service，软件即服务）公司也能有这样的待遇。它们在1999年互联网泡沫破灭前有过辉煌。是的，这很清晰……也很有趣，我看着镜子里的自己，心想，天哪，我老了。我要赶上这第二波浪潮了。第一波是云计算，现在我又能经历一波，我可以分享我的故事了。我甚至有点兴奋，想为《福布斯》写下一篇文章，讲述在一生中经历两次重大技术颠覆是何种感受。

## 医疗健康领域的AI颠覆

### 增强人类能力，重塑工作流程

**Dave Wessinger:** The ability to augment human and replace some of the
mundane tasks, absolutely without question. And I think those are the
things we see. The other thing I would say is the ability to power folks
to be a lot smarter about and prioritize the work they do, so that the
little we have, we'll be able to do so much more with in healthcare.

**Dave Wessinger:**
毫无疑问，AI能够增强人类能力并替代一些单调乏味的任务。我认为这是我们能看到的。另外一点是，AI能让人们更明智地安排和优先处理工作，这样我们就能用有限的资源在医疗保健领域完成更多的事情。

**Dave Wessinger:** But I also would say the thing that I think is very
interesting is that I believe that invariably, the entire industry will
be responding to information and take action. And so it will be a… if
you think about sensors, and you think about the capability to ingest
information, either biosensors, historical information, all of that,
like. This kind of, you need to enter something to have an observation
to react to. Like, thinking about designing anything for a human to
enter something is like, you… What are you talking about? That's not a
thing anymore. And so, when you think about that being kind of, okay,
that's… that barrier is gone, we have full information now, we can kind
of turn that into something we react to. I think it's a really
interesting way to think about the future。

**Dave Wessinger:**
但我也想说，我认为非常有趣的一点是，我相信整个行业最终都将能够响应信息并采取行动。如果你考虑到传感器，考虑到吸收信息的能力，无论是生物传感器、历史信息，还是其他所有信息。那种需要人手动输入信息才能获得观察结果并做出反应的模式——为人类设计任何需要输入东西的系统，这种想法已经过时了。你在说什么？那已经不是未来的方式了。所以，当你想到那个障碍已经消失，我们现在拥有了完整的信息，可以将其转化为我们能够响应的东西时，我认为这是思考未来的一个非常有趣的方式。

### 从图像到诊断：AI的精准医疗潜力

**Dave Wessinger:** But I think in terms of impact, I would tell you
that for any of you who are at Summit or heard me talk to Dr. Rue. What
they're doing in terms of ophthalmology, the ability to kind of read in.
Scan of an eyeball and understand your entire diagnosis, or a
significant portion of it. Think about that one image that will likely
work its way to a phone. Right now, it's a fairly complex piece of
equipment, but it will become commoditized. That in a moment, you can
understand what would otherwise take you hours of assessment. To
understand the human body and understand what to go do from an image in
a moment. That you can effectively drive an entire service plan, plan of
care, what's required, what their diagnosis is, get the right, you know,
treat them appropriately and personalize that. Will be a very
interesting day, and… It's very hard to get that wrong. Right? Because
you're not relying on a human response, right? You're not relying on… or
a response they can't provide, or documentation that might not be
accurate. It's crystal clear. So that advancement in terms of
understanding the person and to know what to do, I think will be… will
be really instrumental in driving the quality of care that these people
deserve.

**Dave Wessinger:**
但就影响力而言，我想告诉你们，在峰会上或听过我与Rue博士交谈的人应该知道，他们在眼科学方面所做的工作——那种通过扫描眼球就能解读并理解你的全部或大部分诊断的能力。想象一下，一张图像，最终可能会在手机上实现。目前这还是一个相当复杂的设备，但它终将商品化。那一刻，你就能理解那些原本需要数小时评估才能了解的信息。在一瞬间通过一张图像就能了解人体状况，并知道下一步该怎么做。你可以有效地制定整个服务计划、护理计划、确定需求、诊断病情，并给予正确、个性化的治疗。那将是非常有趣的一天……而且这种方式很难出错，对吧？因为你不依赖于人的回应，不依赖于他们可能无法提供的回应，也不依赖于可能不准确的文档。一切都清清楚楚。所以，在理解个体和决定行动方案方面的这种进步，我认为将对推动这些人应得的护理质量起到至关重要的作用。

**Alan Missen:** Yeah, it feels very similar to some of the research
I've been doing lately around healthcare and in AI, and your point
around sort of AI-centric scanning technologies. And the accuracy level
and the speed with which they're delivering good data, you know, brain
scans being twice as accurate. As the past bone scans catching people
who have broken bones, who, you know, x-rays weren't catching.
Ambulatory or sort of, triage-related activities, getting to know the
right people who have to go to the hospital versus the ones that aren't
versus EMSs. Yeah, there's a ton going on on there, for sure.

**Alan Missen:**
是的，这与我最近在医疗保健和AI领域所做的一些研究非常相似，特别是你提到的以AI为中心的扫描技术。它们提供高质量数据的准确性和速度令人瞩目，比如脑部扫描的准确性提高了一倍。骨骼扫描能发现那些X光无法捕捉到的骨折。还有在移动医疗或分诊相关的活动中，能够识别出哪些人需要去医院，哪些人不需要，这比急救医疗服务（EMS）更有效。是的，这个领域肯定有很多进展。

**Dave Wessinger:** Preventative early detection, obviously, is kind of
the big cost savings in the quality of life aspect. But we're still
human, we're still gonna vote for those, you know, those wing nights and
the stuff that's like, oh my god, we're gonna create… So, how that
relates to how it extends our life or not, I'm not entirely certain, but
we'll know what to do. The question is, will we do it?

**Dave Wessinger:**
预防性的早期检测，显然是节省成本和提高生活质量的关键。但我们终究是凡人，我们还是会选择去吃那些鸡翅夜宵之类的东西。所以，这与它是否能延长我们的寿命有何关系，我并不完全确定，但我们知道该做什么。问题是，我们会不会去做？

## 关于AI的常见误解与挑战

**Dave Wessinger:** That's a good question. I think it's kind of…. I
don't know that there's any real misconceptions. Are they fearful of it?
I think there's not a fear factor. Uh, but I think there's also a little
bit of ego around, you know, if you think about practitioners or those
that have built a profession on gaining that knowledge around how to...
That's a pretty big thing to separate from, and I think I don't know
that it's a misnomer, kind of. Misunderstood, but I do think there's
areas of healthcare that will receive this faster than others. And I
think there's a huge trust component that is a real thing, and so if the
misconception is that, hey, if it demonstrates an outcome, everyone's
gonna run after it.

**Dave Wessinger:**
这是个好问题。我觉得……我不知道是否存在真正的误解。人们害怕它吗？我认为不存在恐惧因素。但我认为也存在一些自负心理，比如那些从业者，他们的职业生涯建立在掌握特定知识的基础上，要让他们放弃这些是很难的。我不知道这是否算是一种误解，但我确实认为医疗保健的某些领域会比其他领域更快地接受这项技术。信任是一个巨大的、真实存在的因素。所以，如果误解是“嘿，只要它能展示出成果，所有人都会追捧”，那就不对了。

**Dave Wessinger:** I think we're gonna see, with the responsible nature
of it, the ethics, the hallucinations, the… if you're not 99.99999%
right, and you might otherwise kill someone. That's bad. Right? And so,
I think of the situation… we have this today at Point Click Care, by the
way, and it's not even AI. But we make recommendations based on
information in meds that have a clinician go, oh, yeah, that makes
sense. However, that worked out. But the translation from, kind of,
natural language into kind of a structured might make a mistake, and
they have to validate that, because it's right all the time. They'll go,
yep, yep, yep. And once in a while, it's wrong. Well, guess what? That
actually could kill someone. Like, for real, and so now what do you do?
Do you not enable them? Do you go backwards?

**Dave Wessinger:**
我认为，我们会看到，出于责任、道德、幻觉等因素的考虑……如果你不能做到99.99999%的正确，你就有可能害死人。这很糟糕，对吧？我想到了一个情景……顺便说一下，我们在PointClickCare今天就有这种情况，甚至还不是AI。我们根据药物信息提出建议，临床医生看了会说，“哦，是的，这很合理”。然而，从自然语言到结构化指令的转换可能会出错，他们必须验证，因为系统大部分时候都是对的，他们会习惯性地点头确认。但偶尔一次错误，猜猜会发生什么？那真的可能会致命。那么你该怎么办？禁用这个功能吗？走回头路吗？

**Dave Wessinger:** So, there is, like, we all talk about it. I think
the expectation of it just landing and working smoothly, and it's just
they have to get over their own ego, is one thing. But the other part
is, it really has to work. It really has to work, or you're actually
doing harm, and none of us want to do harm, and we believe that today,
humans are in the middle of ensuring that we have that validation and
verification. And should that become just an easy step, we're gonna lose
that, and I do worry about, kind of, just… Not haphazardly, but it just
becomes human nature and behavior that invariably you create some of
these cracks that are unintended. So I think we have to pay attention to
that, and I think it's a little bit harder than we think in healthcare.

**Dave Wessinger:**
所以，我们都在讨论这个问题。期望它能顺利落地并完美运行，认为从业者只需克服自负心理，这是一方面。但另一方面是，它必须真的有效。它必须真的有效，否则你就是在造成伤害，而我们谁都不想造成伤害。我们相信，目前，人类在中间环节起到了验证和核实的作用。如果这个环节变得过于简单，我们就会失去它。我确实担心，并非草率，而是由于人性使然，最终会不可避免地产生一些意想不到的裂痕。所以我认为我们必须关注这一点，而且我认为这在医疗保健领域比我们想象的要困难一些。

**Alan Missen:** Yeah, I totally agree with that. It's another data
point I was reading recently. Kind of comes back to the sort of AI and
trust dynamic. 75% of the public today, consumers, do not trust results
from AI today. And so when you sort of apply that into something as
important as healthcare, that mountain to get over in terms of trust is
definitely a big one for us to deal with.

**Alan Missen:**
是的，我完全同意。我最近读到的另一个数据点也与此相关，回到了AI与信任的动态关系上。如今，75%的公众消费者不信任AI产生的结果。所以当你把这种不信任应用到像医疗保健这样重要的领域时，要跨越的信任大山对我们来说无疑是巨大的。

## 成功的定义：从用例到行动

**Alan Missen:** For me, it kind of comes back to the comment you made
earlier. To me, if we really create a much more robust list of really
powerful use cases that we can actually go action and move on. That, to
me, is a great outcome of today. We've got, I think, north of about 70
different use cases that are being looked at today. I'd love to see that
be, you know, two, three hundred that we're looking at, and then start
really working towards building that skill set to be able to action them
quickly.

**Alan Missen:**
对我来说，这又回到了你之前提到的那一点。如果今天我们能真正创建出一个更强大、更有力的用例清单，并且我们能够实际去执行和推进，那对我来说就是一个巨大的成功。我想我们现在正在研究的用例大约有70多个。我希望这个数字能达到两三百个，然后我们开始真正努力去培养能够快速执行这些用例的技能。

**Dave Wessinger:** Recognize that AI is an amazing thought partner and
collaborator. And so, if you want to write a memo about something you
want to go do… It's not about PowerPoints. I mean, they really run by
memos, and if you want to really thought partner and kind of enhance
your capability in how you think about something. You become, like, your
IQ goes up significantly, and you're kind of way more prepared, way more
intelligent around an aspect of whatever you're thinking about or trying
to improve, or trying to address.

**Dave Wessinger:**
要认识到，AI是一个了不起的思考伙伴和合作者。所以，如果你想就某个计划写一份备忘录……这不是做PowerPoint。我的意思是，他们真的靠备忘录运作。如果你想真正地与AI进行思想碰撞，并提升你思考问题的能力，你的智商会显著提高，你会对你正在思考、试图改进或解决的任何问题，准备得更充分，理解得更透彻。

**Dave Wessinger:** And so you just iterate and iterate and iterate and
iterate, and your ideas become stronger and more thoughtful and more
appropriate, and so whether that's an email or whether that's a memo, or
whether that's, you know, sharing on kind of where you'd like to go, or
a presentation you want to give, or… all of those things, to me will
allow you to perform and move a lot faster.

**Dave Wessinger:**
于是你不断迭代、迭代、再迭代，你的想法会变得更强大、更周全、更恰当。所以无论是写邮件、备忘录，还是分享你的发展方向，或是准备一场演讲……所有这些，在我看来，都能让你表现得更好，行动得更快。

## 未来展望：工作描述的演变

**Dave Wessinger:** Our job descriptions for everybody in the company
will change. Your job description today is already out of date, and we
need to make sure that what you think your job is today, if you're not
growing, you have to have that mindset of, what are you a beginner at?
What are you learning? Absolutely critical, and we will be evaluating on
your progress with AI capability. That's a necessary piece, and I think
Mike talked with Toby from Shopify the other night. And that was kind of
a key indicator, is all of our performance reviews will have an element
of AI to it. What have you done? Have you progressed? What are you
learning? It's just too important for us. We can't miss this one.

**Dave Wessinger:**
公司里每个人的职位描述都将改变。你今天的职位描述已经过时了。我们必须确保，如果你不成长，你就要有这样一种心态：你现在在哪方面是初学者？你在学习什么？这绝对是至关重要的。我们将根据你在AI能力方面的进展进行评估。这是必要的一环。我想Mike前几天晚上和Shopify的Toby谈过，那是一个关键的指标：我们所有的绩效评估都将包含AI的元素。你做了什么？你进步了吗？你在学什么？这对我们太重要了，我们不能错过这次机会。
