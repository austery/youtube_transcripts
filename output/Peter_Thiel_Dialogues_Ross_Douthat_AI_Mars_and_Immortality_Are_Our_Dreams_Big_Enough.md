# 彼得·蒂尔对话罗斯·杜塔特：人工智能、火星与不朽——我们的梦想足够远大吗？

## 引言：对话最具影响力的右翼思想家

**Ross Douthat:** Is Silicon Valley recklessly ambitious? What should we
fear more: Armageddon or stagnation? Why is one of the world’s most
successful investors worrying about the Antichrist? My guest today is
the co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, and an early investor in the
political careers of Donald Trump and JD Vance. Peter Thiel is the
original tech right power player, well known for funding a range of
conservative and simply contrarian ideas. But we’re going to talk about
his own ideas because despite the slight handicap of being a
billionaire, there’s a good case that he’s the most influential right
wing intellectual of the last 20 years. Peter Thiel, welcome to
"Interesting Times."

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
硅谷是否鲁莽地雄心勃勃？我们更应该恐惧的是世界末日还是停滞不前？为何世界上最成功的投资者之一会担心敌基督
(Antichrist) 的出现？我今天的嘉宾是PayPal (支付公司) 和Palantir
(大数据分析公司) 的联合创始人，也是唐纳德·特朗普和J.D. 万斯 (政治人物)
政治生涯的早期投资者。彼得·蒂尔是科技右翼的原始权力玩家，以资助一系列保守派乃至纯粹的逆向思维理念而闻名。但今天我们要谈论的是他自己的思想，因为尽管身为亿万富翁可能算是个小小的障碍，但有充分理由认为，他是过去20年里最具影响力的右翼知识分子。彼得·蒂尔，欢迎来到《有趣的时代》。

**Peter Thiel:** Thanks for having me.

**彼得·蒂尔:** 谢谢你的邀请。

**Ross Douthat:** You’re very welcome. Thanks for being here.

**罗斯·杜塔特:** 不客气，感谢你的到来。

## “未来的终结”：技术停滞论是否依然成立？

**Ross Douthat:** So I want to start by taking you back in time, about
13 or 14 years. You wrote an essay for National Review. The conservative
magazine called "The End of the Future." And basically the argument in
that essay was that the dynamic, fast-paced, ever-changing modern world
was just not nearly as dynamic as people thought, and that actually,
we'd entered a period of technological stagnation. That digital life was
a breakthrough, but not as big a breakthrough as people had hoped. And
that the world was kind of stuck, basically. And you weren’t the only
person to make arguments like this, but it had a special potency coming
from you because you were a Silicon Valley insider who had gotten rich
in the digital revolution. So I’m curious: In 2025, right. Do you think
that diagnosis still holds?

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
我想从带你回到大约13或14年前开始。你曾为保守派杂志《国家评论》(National
Review)
写过一篇文章，题为《未来的终结》。那篇文章的核心论点是，我们所处的这个充满活力、快节奏、不断变化的现代世界，远不如人们想象中那般有活力，实际上，我们已经进入了一个技术停滞的时期。数字生活是一项突破，但并非人们所期望的那么大的突破。世界基本上陷入了停滞。你不是唯一提出这类观点的人，但由你这位在数字革命中致富的硅谷内部人士提出，便具有了特殊的分量。所以我很好奇：在2025年的今天，你认为这个诊断还成立吗？

**Peter Thiel:** Yes, I still broadly believe in the stagnation thesis.
It was never an absolute thesis. So the claim was not that we were
absolutely, completely stuck. It was in some ways a claim about the
velocity had slowed. It wasn’t 0, but that we were, I don’t know. From
1750 to 1970, 200 plus years, were periods of accelerating change where
we were, relentlessly. We’re moving faster. The ships were faster, the
railroads were faster, the cars were faster, the planes were faster. It
culminates in the Concorde and the Apollo missions. And then that in all
sorts of dimensions, things had slowed. There was, I always made an
exception for the world of bits. So we had computers and software and
internet and mobile internet. And then the last 10, 15 years you had
crypto and the A.I. revolution, which I think is in some sense pretty
big. But the question is: Is it enough to really get out of this
generalized sense of stagnation?

**彼得·蒂尔:** 是的，我仍然广泛认同技术停滞论 (Stagnation
Thesis：认为自1970年代以来，除了信息技术，其他领域的科技进步已显著放缓的理论)。这从来不是一个绝对的论断。我的主张并非我们已经完全、彻底地停滞不前了。在某些方面，它是一个关于速度减缓的论断。速度不是零，而是……怎么说呢，从1750年到1970年，这200多年是变革不断加速的时期，我们毫不懈怠地前进。我们移动得更快，船更快，铁路更快，汽车更快，飞机也更快。这一切在协和式飞机和阿波罗登月任务中达到顶峰。然而，自那以后，在各种维度上，事物的发展都慢了下来。我总是把比特世界排除在外。我们拥有了计算机、软件、互联网和移动互联网。在过去的10到15年里，我们又迎来了加密货币和人工智能革命，我认为这在某种意义上是相当重大的。但问题是：这是否足以让我们真正摆脱这种普遍的停滞感？

**Peter Thiel:** And there’s an epistemological question you can start
with on the "Back to the Future" essays: How do we even how do we even
know whether we’re in stagnation or acceleration? Because one of the
features of late modernity is that people are hyperspecialized. And so,
can you say that we’re not making progress in physics unless you’ve
devoted half your life to studying string theory? Or what about quantum
computers? Or what about cancer research and biotech and all these
verticals? And then how much does progress in cancer count versus string
theory? So you have to give weightings to all these things. So it’s, in
theory it’s an extremely, an extremely difficult question to get a
handle of because - yeah, the fact that it’s so hard to answer that we
have ever narrower groups of guardians guarding themselves is itself
cause for skepticism. And so yes, I think broadly we’re in this world
that’s still pretty stuck. It’s not absolutely stuck.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
关于“回到未来”的讨论，我们可以从一个认识论问题开始：我们究竟如何知道自己是处于停滞还是加速状态？因为晚期现代性的一个特征是人们高度专业化。因此，除非你花了半辈子研究弦理论，否则你能断言物理学没有进步吗？量子计算机呢？癌症研究和生物技术以及所有这些垂直领域又如何？癌症研究的进展与弦理论的进展相比，权重又该如何分配？你必须为所有这些事物赋予权重。所以，理论上这是一个极其、极其难以把握的问题。事实上，这个问题如此难以回答，以至于我们有越来越狭隘的专家群体在自我守护，这本身就足以让人产生怀疑。因此，是的，我大致认为我们所处的世界仍然相当停滞。但并非绝对停滞。

**Ross Douthat:** Yeah. You mentioned "Back to the Future." We just
showed our kids the original "Back to the Future." The first one with
Michael J. Fox and of course-

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
是的。你提到了《回到未来》。我们刚给孩子们看了原版的《回到未来》，就是迈克尔·J·福克斯主演的第一部，当然——

**Peter Thiel:** Yeah, it was like 1955 to 1985, 30 years back. And then
the "Back to Future II" was, I think 1985 to 2015, which is now a decade
in the past. And that’s where you had flying cars. And the 2015 future
is wildly divergent from the 1985. The 2015 future. did have Biff Tannen
as a Donald Trump-like figure in some kind of power. So it had some kind
of prescience. But yeah, the big, the big noticeable thing is just how
different the built environment looks. And so one of the strongest cases
for stagnation that I’ve heard is that yeah, if you put someone in a
time machine from various points, they would recognize themselves to be
in a completely different world if they left 1860 or 1890 to 1970, if
those were the 80 years of your lifetime or something like that. But the
world just to my kids, even as children of 2025, looking at 1985, it’s
like the cars were a little different. And no one has phones, but the
world seems fairly similar. So that’s a kind of non-statistical. But
that’s the common sense. That’s the common sense understanding.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
是的，那部电影是从1985年回到30年前的1955年。然后《回到未来2》是从1985年去到2015年，那已经是十年前的过去了。电影里有飞行汽车。2015年的未来与1985年截然不同。2015年的未来确实有一个叫比夫·坦南的角色，他掌握着某种权力，很像唐纳德·特朗普。所以电影有一定的预见性。但是，最显著的一点是建筑环境看起来有多么不同。我听过的支持停滞论最有力的论据之一就是，如果你把不同时期的人放进时间机器，比如让他们从1860年或1890年穿越到1970年，如果那是他们生命中的80年，他们会发现自己身处一个完全不同的世界。但对于我的孩子们，即使是2025年的孩子，看1985年的世界，感觉也只是汽车有点不一样，没人用手机，但世界看起来相当相似。这是一种非统计学的、但却是常识性的理解。

**Ross Douthat:** But are there what would convince you that we were
living through a period of takeoff. Is it just economic growth. Is it
productivity growth. Like what are their numbers for stagnation versus
dynamism that you look at.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
但是，有什么能说服你我们正在经历一个腾飞的时期呢？仅仅是经济增长吗？是生产率增长吗？你关注哪些数据来区分停滞与活力？

**Peter Thiel:** Sure it would be. Well, the economic number would just
be what are your living standards compared to your parents. If you’re a
30-year-old millennial or how are you doing versus when your parents,
your Boomer parents were 30 years old, how did they do at that time.
There are intellectual questions. How many breakthroughs are we having.
How do we quantify these things. What are the returns of going into
research. There certainly are diminishing returns to going into science
or going into academia generally. And then maybe this is why I’m so much
of it feels like this sociopathic, Malthusian kind of an institution,
because you have to throw more and more and more at something to get the
same returns. And at some point, people give up and the thing collapses.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
当然有。经济上的数字就是你的生活水平与你父母的相比如何。如果你是一个30岁的千禧一代，你现在的生活和你父母，也就是婴儿潮一代
(Boome) 的父母30岁时相比怎么样？还有一些智识层面的问题。我们取得了多少突破？我们如何量化这些东西？从事研究的回报是什么？可以肯定的是，投身科学或学术界的回报正在递减。这或许就是为什么我觉得它越来越像一个反社会、马尔萨斯式的机构，因为你必须投入越来越多才能获得同样的回报。到某个节点，人们会放弃，然后整个体系就会崩溃。

## 为何要追求增长？对停滞文化的批判

**Ross Douthat:** Well, right. So let’s pick up on that. Why should we
want growth and dynamism because, as you’ve pointed out in some of your
arguments on the subject, right, there is a kind of cultural change that
happens in the Western world in the 1970s, around the time you think
things slow down and start to stagnate, where people become very anxious
about the costs of growth, the environmental costs, above all. And the
idea being end up with a widely shared perspective that we’re rich
enough. And if we try too hard to get that much richer, the planet won’t
be able to support us. We’ll have degradation of various kinds. And we
should be content with where we are. So what’s wrong with that argument.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
好的，我们来谈谈这个。我们为什么应该追求增长和活力？因为正如你在相关论述中指出的，西方世界在1970年代，也就是你认为事物开始放缓和停滞的时期，发生了一种文化变迁。人们开始对增长的代价，尤其是环境代价，感到非常焦虑。最终形成了一种普遍的观点，即我们已经足够富有了。如果我们过于努力地追求更富有，地球将无法承受。我们会面临各种形式的环境退化。我们应该安于现状。那么，这个论点有什么问题呢？

**Peter Thiel:** Well, I think there are deep reasons the stagnation
happened. So there are always three questions you can ask about history.
What actually happened. And there’s a question you get to what should be
done about it. But there’s also this intermediate question why did it
happen. People ran out of ideas, I think to some extent the institutions
degraded and became risk averse. And these cultural transformations we
can describe. But then I think to some extent, also people had some very
legitimate worries about the future, where if we continue to have
accelerating progress, were you accelerating towards environmental
apocalypse or nuclear apocalypse or things like that. But I think if we
don’t find a way back to the future, I do think the society. I don’t it
unravels. It doesn’t work. The way middle the middle class. I would
define the middle class as the people who expect their kids to do better
than themselves. And when that expectation collapses, we no longer have
a middle class society. And maybe there’s I mean, maybe there’s some way
you can have a feudal society in which things are always static and
stuck, or maybe there’s some way you can shift to some radically
different society, but it’s not the way. It’s not the way the Western
world. It’s not the way the United States has functioned for the first
200 years of its existence.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
我认为停滞的发生有其深层原因。关于历史，你总可以问三个问题：实际发生了什么？应该如何应对？还有一个中间问题：为什么会发生？我认为，人们在某种程度上耗尽了思想，体制退化并变得规避风险。这些文化转型我们可以描述。但同时，我也认为在某种程度上，人们对未来有一些非常合理的担忧，即如果我们继续加速发展，我们是否在加速走向环境末日或核末日之类的灾难。但我认为，如果我们找不到回到未来的路，社会就会……我认为它会瓦解，无法运转。中产阶级的运作方式……我会把中产阶级定义为那些期望自己的孩子比自己过得更好的人。当这种期望破灭时，我们就不再拥有一个中产阶级社会了。也许有某种方式可以建立一个永远静止和停滞的封建社会，或者可以转向某种完全不同的社会，但那不是西方世界的方式，也不是美国建国头200年的运作方式。

**Ross Douthat:** So you think that ordinary people won’t accept
stagnation in the end, it’s that they will rebel and pull things down
around them in the course of that rebellion.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
所以你认为普通人最终不会接受停滞，他们会反抗，并在反抗的过程中摧毁周遭的一切。

**Peter Thiel:** They may rebel or our institutions don’t work. All of
our institutions are predicated on growth. Our budget, our budgets are
certainly predicated on growth. Yeah if you say, I don’t Reagan and
Obama Reagan was consumer capitalism, which is oxymoronic. It was borrow
you don’t save money as a capitalist. You borrow money. And Obama was
low tax socialism, just as oxymoronic as the consumerist capitalism of
Reagan. And yeah, I low tech socialism way better than high tax
socialism, but I worry that it’s not sustainable. At some point you
either the taxes go up or the socialism ends. So it’s deeply, deeply
unstable. And that’s why people are they’re not optimistic. They don’t
think we’ve hit some stable the Greta future. Maybe it can work.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
他们可能会反抗，或者我们的体制无法运转。我们所有的体制都以增长为前提。我们的预算，当然是建立在增长的基础上的。比如，里根和奥巴马。里根推行的是消费资本主义，这本身就是矛盾的。作为资本家，你不是存钱，而是借钱。而奥巴马推行的是低税收社会主义，这和里根的消费资本主义一样矛盾。是的，低税收社会主义远好于高税收社会主义，但我担心它不可持续。到某个时候，要么税收增加，要么社会主义终结。所以这是非常、非常不稳定的。这就是为什么人们不乐观。他们不认为我们已经达到了某种稳定的“格蕾塔未来”。也许那样的未来可以运作。

**Ross Douthat:** This is the Greta Thunberg. Just to be clear, that’s a
reference to Greta Thunberg, the activist best known for anti-climate
change protests. Who to you, I would say represents a kind of symbol of
a anti-growth, effectively authoritarian, environmentalist dominated
future.

**罗斯·杜塔特:** 这里指的是格蕾塔·通贝里 (Greta
Thunberg：瑞典环保活动家，以其激进的气候变化抗议而闻名)。需要明确一下，这是指那位以反气候变化抗议而闻名的活动家格蕾塔·通贝里。对你而言，我想她代表了一种反增长、实际上是威权主义、由环保主义主导的未来的象征。

**Peter Thiel:** Sure but we’re not there yet. We’re not there yet. It
would be. It would be a very, very different society if you actually
lived in a kind of degrowth small Scandinavian villages. I’m not sure
would be North Korea, but it would be. It would be super oppressive.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
当然，但我们还没到那一步。我们还没到那一步。如果你真的生活在一种去增长化的小斯堪的纳维亚村庄里，那将是一个非常、非常不同的社会。我不确定那会是朝鲜，但它会是……它会是超级压抑的。

## 渴望危机：逃离“颓废”的风险

**Ross Douthat:** One thing that’s always struck me is that when you
have this sense of stagnation, a sense of decadence, right to use a word
that I like to use for it in a society. You then also have people who
end up being kind of eager for a crisis, right. Eager for a moment to
come along where they can. They can radically redirect society from the
path it’s on. Because I tend to think that in rich societies you hit a
certain level of wealth. People become very comfortable, they become
risk averse, and it’s just hard. It’s hard to get out of decadence, into
something, into something new, without a crisis. So the original example
for me was after September 11. There was this whole mentality among
foreign policy conservatives that we had been decadent and stagnant, and
now is our time to wake up and launch a new crusade and remake the
world. And obviously that ended very badly.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
有一件事一直让我印象深刻，当社会中存在这种停滞感，一种颓废感——我喜欢用这个词来形容它——你就会发现有人开始渴望一场危机。他们渴望一个时机到来，可以从根本上改变社会前进的道路。因为我倾向于认为，在富裕社会中，当财富达到一定水平，人们会变得非常安逸，规避风险，就很难摆脱颓废，进入新的事物，没有危机就很难。对我来说，最初的例子是9/11之后。当时外交政策领域的保守派普遍存在一种心态，认为我们之前一直颓废和停滞，现在是我们觉醒、发起一场新“十字军东征”、重塑世界的时刻。显然，那场运动的结局非常糟糕。

**Peter Thiel:** But something similar it was Bush 43 just told people
to go shopping right away. So it wasn’t anti decadent for the most part.
So there was maybe there was some neocon foreign policy enclave in which
people were LARPing as a way to get out of decadence. But the dominant
thing was Bush 43 people telling people just to go shopping.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
但类似地，小布什（第43任总统）当时只是让人们马上去购物。所以在很大程度上，这并非反颓废。也许在某个新保守主义的外交政策小圈子里，人们在进行实况角色扮演
(LARPing)，试图摆脱颓废。但主流的声音是小布什让人们去购物。

**Ross Douthat:** So what risks should you be willing to take to escape
decadence? It does seem like there’s a danger here where the people who
want to be anti decadent have to take on a lot of risk. They have to
say, look, you’ve got this nice, stable, comfortable society. But guess
what. We’d we’d like to have a war or a crisis or a total reorganization
of government and so on. They have to lean into danger.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
那么，为了逃离颓废，我们应该愿意承担什么样的风险？这里似乎存在一个危险，即那些想要反颓废的人必须承担巨大的风险。他们必须说：“看，你们拥有一个美好、稳定、舒适的社会。但你猜怎么着？我们想发动一场战争，或制造一场危机，或彻底重组政府等等。”他们必须拥抱危险。

**Peter Thiel:** I don’t know if I have to answer. I don’t know if I
have to give you a precise answer, but my directional answer is a lot
more. We should take a lot more risk. We should be doing a lot more. And
I can go through all these different verticals. If we look at biotech,
something like dementia, Alzheimer’s, we’ve made zero progress in 40 to
50 years. People are completely stuck on beta amyloid. It’s obviously
not working. It’s just some kind of a stupid racket where the people are
just reinforcing themselves. And so Yes, we need to take way more risk
in that department.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
我不确定我是否必须回答这个问题，或者是否能给你一个精确的答案，但我的方向性答案是：要承担多得多的风险。我们应该承担更多风险，做得更多。我可以列举所有不同的垂直领域。如果我们看生物技术，比如痴呆症、阿尔茨海默症，我们在四五十年里毫无进展。人们完全固守于β-淀粉样蛋白假说。这显然行不通。这只是一种愚蠢的骗局，人们在其中自我强化。所以，是的，我们需要在那个领域承担更大的风险。

**Ross Douthat:** Well, let’s I want to ask to keep us in the concrete.
I want to stay with that example for a minute and ask, O.K, what does
that mean. Saying we need to take more risks in anti-aging research.
Does it mean that the FDA has to step back and say, anyone who has a new
treatment for Alzheimer’s can go ahead and sell it on the open market.
Like what is risk in the medical space look like.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
好的，为了让讨论更具体，我想就这个例子追问一下。说我们需要在抗衰老研究中承担更多风险，这具体意味着什么？是指FDA
(美国食品药品监督管理局)
必须放宽监管，允许任何有阿尔茨海默症新疗法的人直接在公开市场上销售吗？在医疗领域，“风险”究竟是什么样的？

**Peter Thiel:** Yeah you would take you would take a lot more risk. If
you have disease, there probably are a lot more risks. You can take.
There are a lot more risks the researchers can take. Culturally, what I
imagine it looks like is early modernity where people Yeah, they thought
we would cure diseases. They thought we would have radical life
extension. Immortality that was part of the project of early modernity.
It was Francis Bacon, Condorcet it was and maybe it was maybe it was
anti-Christian, maybe it was downstream of Christianity. It was
competitive. If Christianity promised you a physical Resurrection
science was not going to succeed unless it promised you the exact same
thing.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
是的，你会承担多得多的风险。如果你患有疾病，你可能愿意承担更多风险。研究人员也可以承担更多风险。在文化上，我所想象的景象是早期现代性时期，那时人们确实认为我们可以治愈疾病，实现彻底的生命延长。不朽，这是早期现代性计划的一部分。弗朗西斯·培根、孔多塞都是如此。这或许是反基督教的，或许是基督教思想的延伸。它具有竞争性。如果基督教向你承诺肉身复活，那么科学若不承诺同样的东西，就无法成功。

**Peter Thiel:** But I remember 1999, 99 2000. When we were running
PayPal, one of my co-founders, Luke Nozick, he was into Alcor and
cryonics and people should freeze themselves and and we had one day
where we took the whole company to a freezing party, a Tupperware party.
People sell Tupperware policies at a freezing party. They sell their.
Was it just your heads. What was going to be frozen. You could get could
get a full body or just a head. Just the head was cheaper. It was
disturbing. With a dot matrix printer didn’t quite work. And so the
freezing policies couldn’t be couldn’t be printed out. But in
retrospect, this was still technological stagnation once again. But it
was. But it’s also a symptom of the decline because in 1999, this was
not a mainstream view, but there was still a fringe Boomer view where
they still believed they could live forever. And that was the last
generation. And so I’m always anti Boomer, but maybe there’s something
we’ve lost even in this fringe Boomer narcissism where there were at
least a few boomers who still believed science would cure all their
diseases. No one, no one who’s a millennial believes that anymore.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
我还记得1999年、2000年，我们运营PayPal的时候，我的一个联合创始人卢克·诺塞克（Luke
Nosek），他热衷于Alcor公司和人体冷冻技术
(cryonics)，认为人们应该冷冻自己。有一天我们带全公司去参加一个“冷冻派对”，就像特百惠派对一样。人们在冷冻派对上推销冷冻协议。他们推销……只冷冻头吗？要冷冻什么？你可以选择全身冷冻或者只冷冻头部。只冷冻头更便宜。那场面挺令人不安的。点阵打印机还不太好用，所以冷冻协议都打印不出来。但回想起来，这再次暴露了当时的技术停滞。但它也是衰落的一个症状，因为在1999年，这虽然不是主流观点，但仍有一种边缘的婴儿潮一代的观点，他们仍然相信自己可以永生。那是最后一代人了。我总是反感婴儿潮一代，但也许在这种边缘的婴儿潮一代的自恋中，我们失去了一些东西，至少还有少数人相信科学能治愈他们所有的疾病。现在，没有一个千禧一代再相信这个了。

## 从科技到政治：作为风险投资的政治参与

**Ross Douthat:** I think there are some people who believe in a
different kind of immortality, though, right now. I think part of the
fascination with A.I. is connected to a specific, a specific vision of
transcending limits. And I’m going to ask you about that after I ask you
about politics, because one of the striking things I thought about your
original argument on stagnation, which was mostly about technology and
the economy, was that it could be applied to a pretty wide range of
things. And at the time you were writing that essay, you were interested
in seasteading. This idea of ideas of essentially building new polities
independent of the sclerotic Western world. But then you made a pivot in
the 2010s. So you were one of the few prominent, maybe the only
prominent Silicon Valley supporter of Donald Trump. In 2016, you
supported a few carefully selected Republican Senate candidates. One of
them is now the vice president of the United States. And my view as an
observer of what you were doing was that you were basically being a kind
of venture capitalist for politics. You were saying, here are some
disruptive agents who might change the political status quo, and it’s
worth a certain kind of risk here. Is that how you thought about it.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
不过，我认为现在有些人相信另一种形式的不朽。我认为对人工智能的迷恋，部分原因与一种超越极限的特定愿景有关。我稍后会问你这个问题，但在那之前我想先谈谈政治。因为我认为你关于停滞的原始论点，虽然主要关注技术和经济，但可以应用于非常广泛的领域，这一点很引人注目。在你写那篇文章的时候，你对“海上家园”
(seasteading：在公海建立不受现有国家管辖的永久居住地的概念)
感兴趣，即建立独立于僵化的西方世界的新政体。但到了2010年代，你做出了一个转向。你成了少数几位，或许是唯一一位，支持唐纳德·特朗普的硅谷知名人士。2016年，你支持了几位精心挑选的共和党参议院候选人，其中一位现在是美国的副总统。作为观察者，我认为你当时基本上是在扮演政治领域的风险投资家。你在说，这里有一些可能改变政治现状的颠覆性力量，值得冒一定的风险。你是这么想的吗？

**Peter Thiel:** Sure there were all sorts of levels. I mean, one level
was yeah, it was these hopes that we could redirect the Titanic from the
iceberg it was heading to or whatever the metaphor has really changed
course as a society through political, through political change. Maybe a
narrower a much narrower aspiration was that we could maybe at least
have a conversation about this when someone like Trump said, make
America great again. O.K is that a positive, optimistic, ambitious
agenda, or is it merely a very pessimistic assessment of where that we
are no longer a great country. And I didn’t have great expectations
about what Trump would do in a positive way. But I thought, at least for
the first time in 100 years, we had a Republican who was not giving us
this syrupy Bush nonsense. And that was not the same as progress, but we
could at least have a conversation. In retrospect, this was a
preposterous fantasy.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
当然，这其中有多个层面。一个层面是，是的，我希望我们能通过政治变革，让社会这艘“泰坦尼克号”避开它正驶向的冰山，或者说，真正改变航向。一个更狭隘的愿望是，当像特朗普这样的人说出“让美国再次伟大”时，我们至少可以就此展开一场对话。这到底是一个积极、乐观、雄心勃勃的议程，还是仅仅对我们已不再是伟大国家这一现状的悲观评估？我并没有对特朗普能做出什么积极的改变抱有太大期望。但我想，至少这是100年来，我们第一次有了一位共和党人，不再给我们灌输那种甜腻的布什式废话。这不等同于进步，但至少我们可以进行一场对话。回想起来，这是一种荒谬的幻想。

**Peter Thiel:** I had these two thoughts and in 2016, and you often
have these ideas that are just below the level of your consciousness.
But the two thoughts I had that I wasn’t able to combine was, number
one, no, nobody would be mad at me for supporting Trump if he lost. And
number two, I thought he had a 50/50 chance of winning. And then I had
this implicit, why would nobody be mad at you if he lost. It would just
be such a weird thing and it wouldn’t really matter. But then I thought
he had more. He had. I thought he had a 50/50 chance because the
problems were deep and the stagnation was frustrating. And then the
fantasy I had was yeah, if he won, we could have this conversation. And
the reality was people weren’t ready for it. And then maybe we’ve
progressed to the point where we can have this conversation at this
point in 2025, a decade after Trump. And of course, you’re not a zombie
left wing person. Ross but but this is I’ve been called many things.
Many things I’ll take. I’ll take whatever progress I can get.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
2016年我有两个想法，这些想法常常潜藏在你的意识之下。我当时无法整合的两个想法是：第一，如果特朗普输了，没人会因为我支持他而生我的气。第二，我认为他有五五开的获胜机会。我当时有一个隐含的想法：为什么他输了就没人会生你的气？因为那将是一件非常奇怪的事情，也就无足轻重了。但我又觉得他有很大机会。我认为他有五五开的胜算，因为问题很深，停滞感令人沮丧。然后我幻想，是的，如果他赢了，我们就能展开这场对话。而现实是，人们还没准备好。也许现在，在2025年，特朗普之后十年，我们已经进步到可以进行这场对话的程度了。当然，罗斯，你不是一个僵尸般的左翼人士。但是……我被人叫过很多称呼了。很多称呼我都能接受。我乐于接受任何我能得到的进步。

**Ross Douthat:** So from your perspective of. So let’s say there’s two
layers. There’s a basic sense of this society needs disruption. It needs
risk. Trump is disruption, Trump is risk and Trump is. And then the
second level is Trump is actually willing to say things that are true
about American decline, right. So do you feel like you as an investor,
as a venture capitalist, got anything out of the first Trump term. Like
what did Trump do in his first term that you felt was anti decadent or
anti stagnation? If anything, maybe the answer is nothing.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
所以从你的角度看，这有两个层次。首先是一个基本的认知：这个社会需要颠覆，需要风险。特朗普就是颠覆，是风险。然后第二个层次是，特朗普实际上愿意说出关于美国衰落的真相，对吧？那么，作为一名投资者，一名风险资本家，你觉得你从特朗普的第一个任期中获得了什么吗？在他的第一个任期内，他做了什么你认为是反颓废或反停滞的事情？如果有什么的话，也许答案是什么都没有。

**Peter Thiel:** Well I think we I think it took longer and it was
slower than I would have liked. But we have, we have gotten to the place
where a lot of people think something’s gone wrong. And that was not the
conversation I was having in 2012, 2013, 2014. I had a debate with Eric
Schmidt in 2012 and Marc Andreessen in 2013 and Bezos in 2014. I was on
the there’s a stagnation problem, and all three of them were versions of
everything’s going great. And I think at least those three people have,
to varying degrees, updated and adjusted.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
我认为这比我期望的时间更长，进展更慢。但我们确实已经走到了这一步：很多人都认为出了问题。这在2012、2013、2014年是无法进行的对话。我2012年与埃里克·施密特辩论，2013年与马克·安德森辩论，2014年与贝佐斯辩论。我的观点是存在停滞问题，而他们三个人都持“一切都很好”的论调。我认为，至少这三个人都已经在不同程度上更新和调整了自己的看法。

**Ross Douthat:** Silicon Valley is adjusted and Silicon Valley, though
has more than adjusted. A a big part of Silicon Valley on the stagnation
on the stagnation, stagnation. But then a big part of Silicon Valley
ended up going in for Trump in 2024, including, obviously, most
famously, Elon Musk.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
硅谷调整了看法，而且不止是调整。硅谷的很大一部分人也认同了停滞论。但随后，在2024年，硅谷的很大一部分人最终转向支持特朗普，其中最著名的显然是埃隆·马斯克。

**Peter Thiel:** Yeah, this is deeply linked to the stagnation issue in
my telling. I mean, these things are always super complicated, but my
telling is I don’t. And again, I’m so hesitant to speak for all these
people. But someone like Mark Zuckerberg or Facebook meta. And in some
ways, I don’t think he was very ideological. He didn’t think this stuff
through that much. It was the default was to be liberal. And it was
always what if the liberalism isn’t working, what do you do. And for
year after year after year, it was do more if something doesn’t work,
you just need to do more of it. And you up the dose and you up the dose
and you spend hundreds of millions of dollars and you go completely woke
and everybody hates you. And at some point, it’s like, O.K, maybe this
isn’t working.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
是的，在我看来，这与停滞问题密切相关。这些事情总是极其复杂，但我的说法是……再次声明，我非常不愿意代表所有这些人发言。但像马克·扎克伯格或Facebook（现在的Meta），在某些方面，我认为他并不是非常意识形态化。他没有想得那么透彻。默认立场是自由派。问题总是，如果自由主义行不通，你该怎么办？年复一年，答案都是“做得更多”。如果某件事不起作用，你只需要做得更多。你不断加大剂量，再加大剂量，花费数亿美元，变得完全“觉醒”(woke)，结果每个人都讨厌你。到某个时候，你就会想，好吧，也许这真的行不通。

## 硅谷的政治转向与特朗普2.0的动态潜力

**Ross Douthat:** So they pivot. So it’s not a pro-trump thing. It’s not
a pro-trump thing, but it is just both in public and private
conversations. It is a kind of sense that Trumpism and populism in 2024,
maybe not in 2016, when Peter was out there as the lone supporter. But
now in 2024, they can be a vehicle for technological innovation,
economic dynamism. So that’s your framing it really, really
optimistically here. So I. Well the people but I think I know you’re
pessimistic. You frame this optimistically. You’re just saying these
people are going to be disappointed and they’re just set up for failure.
And things like, I mean, people expressed a lot of optimism. That’s all
I’m saying. Elon Musk expressed a lot of I mean, he expressed some
apocalyptic anxieties about how budget deficits were going to kill us
all. But he came into government and people around him came into
government basically saying, we have a partnership with the Trump
administration, and we’re pursuing technological greatness. I think they
were optimistic. And so I’m you’re coming from a place of greater
pessimism or realism. So I’m just what I’m asking for is your assessment
of where we are, not their assessment. But like, do you think does
populism in Trump 2.0 look like a vehicle for technological dynamism to
you.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
所以他们转向了。这并非是支持特朗普，而是在公开和私下的谈话中都流露出一种感觉，即2024年的特朗普主义和民粹主义，也许不像2016年彼得作为孤独支持者时那样，但现在，它们可以成为技术创新和经济活力的载体。你在这里的表述非常非常乐观。我知道你其实是悲观的。你这样乐观地表述，只是想说这些人最终会失望，注定会失败。我的意思是，人们表达了大量的乐观情绪。这就是我想说的。埃隆·马斯克表达了很多……他确实表达了关于预算赤字将如何毁灭我们的末日焦虑。但他和他周围的人进入政府时，基本上都在说，我们与特朗普政府建立了伙伴关系，我们正在追求技术上的伟大。我认为他们是乐观的。而你则是从一个更悲观或更现实的立场出发。所以我想要的不是他们的评估，而是你对我们现状的评估。你认为，特朗普2.0时代的民粹主义，对你来说像是一个推动技术活力的工具吗？

**Peter Thiel:** It’s still by far the best option we have, I don’t
think. I don’t know. Is Harvard going to cure dementia by just puttering
along, doing the same thing that hasn’t worked for 50 years. So that’s
just a case for it. Can’t get it, can’t get worse. Let’s do disruption.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
我认为这仍然是目前为止我们最好的选择。我不知道。哈佛大学会通过继续修修补补、做着50年来都无效的事情来治愈痴呆症吗？所以，这就是支持它的理由。情况不会变得更糟了。让我们来点颠覆吧。

**Ross Douthat:** But the critique of the critique of populism right now
would be Silicon Valley made an alliance with the populists. But in the
end, the populists don’t care about science. They don’t want to spend
money on science. They want to kill funding to Harvard just because they
don’t like Harvard. And in the end, you’re not going to get the kind of
investments in the future that Silicon Valley wanted. Is that wrong.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
但现在对民粹主义的批判观点是，硅谷与民粹主义者结盟了。但最终，民粹主义者并不关心科学。他们不想在科学上花钱。他们想砍掉哈佛的经费，仅仅因为他们不喜欢哈佛。最终，你不会得到硅谷想要的那种对未来的投资。这个看法错了吗？

**Peter Thiel:** Yeah, but it. We have to go back to this question of,
how well is this. Is the science working in the background. This is
where the new dealers. Whatever was wrong with them. They pushed science
hard and you funded it, and you gave money to people and you scaled it.
And whereas today, if there was an equivalent of Einstein and he wrote a
letter to the White House, it would get lost in the mail room, and the
Manhattan Project is unthinkable. If we call something a moonshot the
way this is the way Biden talked about, let’s say, cancer research, a
moonshot in the 60s still meant that you went to the moon. A moonshot
now means something completely fictional. That’s never going to happen.
No, you need a moonshot for that. It’s not like we need an Apollo
program. It means it’s never, ever going to happen. And so.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
是的，但我们必须回到这个问题：科学在后台运作得如何？这就像罗斯福新政时期的人。不管他们有什么问题，他们都大力推动科学，你资助它，给人们钱，扩大规模。而今天，如果有一个像爱因斯坦一样的人给白宫写信，信会在收发室里丢失，曼哈顿计划是不可想象的。如果我们像拜登谈论癌症研究那样，把某件事称为“登月计划”(moonshot)，在60年代，“登月计划”意味着你真的要登上月球。而现在，“登月计划”意味着某件完全虚构、永远不会发生的事情。不是说我们需要一个阿波罗计划，而是说它永远、永远不会发生。

**Ross Douthat:** But it seems like then you’re still in the mode of for
you, as opposed to maybe for some other people in Silicon Valley. The
value of populism is in tearing away the veils and illusions, and we’re
not necessarily in the stage where you’re looking to the Trump
administration to build the new, to do the Manhattan Project, to do the
moonshot. It’s more like populism helps us see that it was all fake.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
那么，看起来你仍然处于这样一种模式：对你而言，与硅谷的其他人可能不同，民粹主义的价值在于揭开面纱和幻象。我们还不一定处于指望特朗普政府去建设新事物、去搞曼哈顿计划、去实现登月计划的阶段。它更像是民粹主义帮助我们看清一切都是虚假的。

**Peter Thiel:** You need to try to do both. And they’re very entangled
with each other. And I don’t know, there’s a deregulation of nuclear
power. And at some point, at some point we’ll get back to building, new
nuclear power plants or better designed ones, or maybe even fusion
reactors. And, and so, yes, there’s a deregulatory, deconstructive part.
And then at some point, you actually to get to construction and it’s all
things like that. So yeah, in some ways, in some ways you’re clearing
the field and then but you’ve maybe but you’ve personally stopped
funding politicians I am schizophrenic on this stuff. I think it is. It
is it’s incredibly important and it’s incredibly toxic. And so I go I go
back and forth on incredibly toxic for you personally for everybody,
everybody who gets involved. It’s 0 sum. It’s crazy. And then it’s and
then in some ways because everyone hates you and associates you with
Trump. Like how is it toxic for you personally.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
你需要尝试两者兼顾。它们是紧密纠缠在一起的。比如，放松对核能的管制。到某个时候，我们会重新开始建造新的、设计更好的核电站，甚至可能是聚变反应堆。所以，是的，有放松管制、解构的部分。然后到某个阶段，你才真正开始建设。诸如此类。在某些方面，你是在清理场地。但你个人已经停止资助政客了……我在这件事上是精神分裂的。我认为它既极其重要，又极其有毒。所以我来回摇摆。它对每个参与其中的人都有毒。这是零和游戏。很疯狂。在某些方面，因为每个人都恨你，把你和特朗普联系在一起，这对你个人来说怎么会有毒呢？

**Peter Thiel:** It’s toxic because it’s in a zero sum world. The stakes
in it feel really, really high. And you end up having enemies you didn’t
have before. It’s toxic for all the people who get involved in different
ways.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
它有毒，因为它是一个零和世界。其中的利害关系感觉非常非常高。你最终会树立你以前没有的敌人。它对所有以不同方式参与其中的人都有毒。

## 火星计划、觉醒AI与政治项目的极限

**Peter Thiel:** There is a political dimension of getting "Back to the
Future." I don’t know. This is a conversation I had with Elon back in
2024. And we had all these conversations. I had the seasteading version
with Elon where I said if Trump doesn’t win, I want to just leave the
country. And then Elon said, there’s nowhere to go. There’s nowhere to
go. This is the only place. And then you always think of the right
arguments to make later. And it was about two hours after we had dinner
and I was home that I thought of, wow, Elon, you don’t believe in going
to Mars anymore. 2024 2024 is the year where Elon stopped believing in
Mars. Not as a silly science tech project, but as a political project.
Mars was supposed to be a political project. It was building an
alternative. And in 2024, Elon came to believe that if you went to Mars
the socialist US government, the woke A.I., it would follow you to Mars.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
“回到未来”有一个政治维度。我不知道。这是我在2024年和埃隆（马斯克）的一次对话。我们有过很多这样的对话。我曾和他谈过“海上家园”的版本，我说如果特朗普不赢，我就想离开这个国家。然后埃隆说，无处可去。无处可去。这是唯一的地方。你总是在事后才想到正确的论据。晚饭后大约两个小时，我回到家才想到，哇，埃隆，你不再相信去火星了。2024年，是埃隆不再相信火星的一年。不是把它当做一个愚蠢的科技项目，而是作为一个政治项目。火星本应是一个政治项目，是建立一个替代方案。而在2024年，埃隆开始相信，即使你去了火星，社会主义的美国政府、觉醒的人工智能
(woke A.I.)，也会跟着你到火星。

**Peter Thiel:** It was the dumbest meeting with Elon that we brokered.
He was doing DeepMind. This is an A.I. company. Yeah this was the rough
conversation was Dennis tells Ellen, I’m working on the most important
project in the world. I’m building a superhuman A.I. And Ellen responds
to Dennis, well, I’m working on the most important project in the world.
I am turning us into an interplanetary species. And then Dennis said,
well, my A.I. will be able to follow you to Mars and. And then Ellen
went quiet. But in my telling of the history, it took years for that to
really hit Ellen. It took him until 2024 to process it.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
那是我们为埃隆安排的最蠢的一次会面。他当时在做DeepMind（一家人工智能公司）。是的，大致的对话是这样的：丹米斯（·哈萨比斯，DeepMind创始人）告诉埃隆：“我正在做世界上最重要的项目，我正在构建一个超人AI。”
埃隆回应丹米斯：“嗯，我正在做世界上最重要的项目，我正在把我们变成一个星际物种。”
然后丹米斯说：“嗯，我的AI能跟着你到火星去。”
之后埃隆就沉默了。但在我的历史叙述中，这件事花了好几年才真正触动埃隆。他直到2024年才消化了它。

**Ross Douthat:** But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t believe in Mars. It
just means that he decided he had to win some kind of battle over budget
deficits or wokeness to get to Mars. What does Mars mean. Is it a Yeah.
Is it. And again, it’s what does Mars mean. Well, it was is it just is
it just a scientific project or is it I don’t know. Is it like A.I.
don’t know, high vision of a new society. Yeah Heinlein. Populated by
many, many libertarian paradise or something like Elon Musk.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
但那不意味着他不相信火星了。只是意味着他决定必须先赢得一场关于预算赤字或“觉醒文化”的战斗，才能去火星。火星意味着什么？它只是……再次强调，火星到底意味着什么？它仅仅是一个科学项目，还是像……我不知道，像一个关于新社会的高远愿景？像海因莱因小说里那样，由众多自由主义者组成的乐园，或者类似埃隆·马斯克的设想？

**Peter Thiel:** Well, I assume it was concretized that specifically.
But if you concretize things, then maybe you realize that Mars is
supposed to be more than a science project, it’s supposed to be a
political project. And then when you concretize it, you have to start
thinking through, well, the I woke, I will follow you, the socialist
government will follow you, and then maybe you have to do something
other than just going to Mars.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
我想它已经被具体化到那个程度了。但如果你把事情具体化，你可能会意识到火星应该不仅仅是一个科学项目，它应该是一个政治项目。当你把它具体化之后，你就必须开始思考，嗯，觉醒AI会跟着你，社会主义政府会跟着你，那么也许你除了去火星之外，还必须做点别的事情。

## AI：停滞中的例外，还是新的陷阱？

**Ross Douthat:** O.K., so the woke A.I. Artificial intelligence seems
like one. If we’re still stagnant, it’s the biggest exception to
stagnation. Yes it’s the place where there’s been. Yes remarkable
progress. Surprising to many people. Progress it’s also the place we
were just talking about politics. It’s the place where the Trump
administration is, I think, to a large degree, giving A.I. investors a
lot of what they wanted in terms of both stepping back and doing public
private partnerships. So it’s a zone of progress and governmental
engagement. And you are an investor in A.I. What do you think you’re
investing in?

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
好的，觉醒AI。人工智能似乎是一个例外。如果我们仍然处于停滞状态，那它就是停滞中最大的例外。是的，这是一个取得了显著进步的领域，让许多人感到惊讶。它也是我们刚才谈到政治时涉及的领域。我认为，特朗普政府在很大程度上，通过放宽监管和建立公私伙伴关系，给予了AI投资者他们想要的很多东西。所以这是一个进步与政府参与并存的区域。你也是AI的投资者。你认为你在投资什么？

**Peter Thiel:** Well, I don’t know, there’s a lot of layers to this. So
I do think I know there’s one, one question we can frame is just how big
how big a thing do I think AI is. And I don’t my stupid answer is it’s
somewhere it’s more than a nothing burger and it’s less than the total
transformation of our society. So my placeholder is that it’s roughly on
the scale of the internet in the late 90s, which is I’m not sure it’s
enough to really end the stagnation. It might be enough to create some
great companies. And the internet added maybe a few points, percentage
points to the GDP, maybe 1 percent to GDP growth every year for 10, 15
years. It added some to productivity. And so that’s of roughly my
placeholder for I. It’s the only thing we have. It’s a little bit
unhealthy that it’s so unbalanced. This is the only thing we have. I’d
like to have more multi-dimensional progress. I’d like us to be going to
Mars. I’d like us to be having cures for dementia. If all we have is I
will take it. There are risks with it. There are obviously there are
dangers with this technology.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
这里有很多层次。有一个问题我们可以这样构建：我到底认为AI有多重要？我那个愚蠢的答案是，它介于“无足轻重”和“彻底改变社会”之间。我暂时的定位是，它的规模大致相当于90年代末的互联网。我不确定这是否足以真正终结停滞。它或许足以创造一些伟大的公司。互联网可能为GDP贡献了几个百分点，可能在10到15年里每年为GDP增长贡献1%。它也对生产力有所贡献。所以这大概是我对AI的初步定位。它是我们唯一拥有的东西。发展如此不平衡有点不健康。这是我们唯一拥有的。我希望我们能有多维度的进步。我希望我们能去火星。我希望我们能治愈痴呆症。如果只有AI，我也会接受。它有风险，这项技术显然存在危险。

**Ross Douthat:** So you’re a skeptic. But then you are a skeptic of
what you might call the superintelligence cascade theory, which
basically says that if AI succeeds, it gets so smart that it gives us
the progress in the world of atoms, that it’s like, all right, we can’t
cure dementia. We can’t figure out how to build the perfect factory that
builds the rockets that go to Mars. But I can and and at a certain
point, you pass a certain threshold and it gives us not just more
digital progress, but 64 other forms of progress. It sounds like you
don’t believe that, or you think that’s less likely.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
所以你是个怀疑论者。那么你对所谓的“超智能级联理论”也持怀疑态度。该理论基本认为，如果AI成功了，它会变得如此聪明，以至于能为我们在原子世界带来进步。就像是说：“好吧，我们治不好痴呆症。我们想不出如何建造能制造去火星的完美工厂。但我可以。”
到某个时刻，你越过某个阈值，它不仅能给我们带来更多的数字进步，还能带来64种其他形式的进步。听起来你并不相信这个，或者你认为可能性不大。

**Peter Thiel:** Yeah I somehow don’t know if that’s been really the
gating factor. What does that mean. The gating factor. It’s probably a
Silicon Valley ideology. And maybe in a weird way it’s more liberal than
a conservative thing. But people are really fixated on IQ in Silicon
Valley and that it’s all about smart people. And if you have more smart
people, they will. Do great things. And then the economics antique
argument is that people actually do worse. The smarter they are, the
worse they do. And, it’s just they don’t know how to apply it or our
society doesn’t know what to do with them and they don’t fit in. And so
that suggests that the gating factor isn’t IQ, but something that’s
deeply wrong with our society.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
是的，我不知怎地不确定那是否真的是限制因素。限制因素……这可能是一种硅谷的意识形态。而且可能以一种奇怪的方式，它更偏向自由派而非保守派。硅谷的人非常迷恋智商（IQ），认为一切都取决于聪明人。如果你有更多聪明人，他们就会做出伟大的事情。然而，经济学上的一个老旧论点是，人们实际上做得更差。他们越聪明，做得越差。他们只是不知道如何应用自己的才智，或者我们的社会不知道如何对待他们，他们无法融入。这表明，限制因素不是智商，而是我们社会中某些深层次的问题。

**Ross Douthat:** So is that a limit on intelligence or a problem of the
personality types. Well, it’s human superintelligence creates. I mean,
I’m very sympathetic to the idea. And I made this case when I did an
episode of this podcast with AI accelerationist that just throwing that
certain problems can just be solved if you ramp up intelligence. It’s
like we ramp up intelligence and boom, Alzheimer’s is solved. We ramp up
intelligence and the I can, figure out the automation process that
builds you a billion robots overnight. I’m an intelligent skeptic in the
sense I don’t think. Yeah, I think you probably have limits. It’s hard
to prove one way. It’s always hard to prove these things. But I until we
have the superintelligence, I share your intuition because I think we’ve
had a lot of smart people and things have been stuck for other reasons.
And so maybe the problems are unsolvable, which is the pessimistic view.
Maybe there is no cure for dementia at all. And it’s a deeply unsolvable
problem. There’s no cure for mortality. Maybe it’s an unsolvable
problem, or maybe it’s these cultural things. So it’s not the
individually smart person, but it’s how this fits into our society. Do
we tolerate heterodox smart people. Maybe it’s maybe you need heterodox
smart people to crazy experiments and if the AI is just conventionally
smart, if we define wokeness, again, wokeness is too ideological, but if
you just define it as conformist, maybe that’s not the kind of smartness
that’s going to make a difference.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
那么这是智力的极限，还是人格类型的问题？人类超智能的创造……我非常同情这个想法。我在与一位AI加速主义者做播客节目时也提出了这个观点，即只要提升智能，某些问题就能迎刃而解。就像我们提升智能，然后“砰”，阿尔茨海默症就解决了。我们提升智能，AI就能想出自动化流程，一夜之间为你造出十亿个机器人。我是一个理性的怀疑论者，因为我不认为……是的，我认为可能存在极限。这很难单方面证明。这些事情总是很难证明。但在我们拥有超智能之前，我认同你的直觉，因为我认为我们已经有很多聪明人了，但事情因为其他原因停滞不前。所以，也许问题是无解的，这是悲观的看法。也许痴呆症根本没有治愈方法，这是一个深层次的无解问题。死亡也没有治愈方法。也许这是一个无解问题，或者也许是这些文化因素。所以问题不在于某个聪明的个体，而在于他如何融入我们的社会。我们能容忍异见的聪明人吗？也许你需要异见的聪明人去做疯狂的实验，而如果AI只是传统意义上的聪明，如果我们把“觉醒”定义为……“觉醒”这个词太意识形态化了，但如果你把它定义为“循规蹈矩”，那也许就不是那种能带来改变的聪明。

**Ross Douthat:** So do you fear, then, a plausible future where AI, in
a way becomes itself stagnation, that it’s like highly intelligent,
creative in a conformist way. It’s like the Netflix algorithm. It makes
infinite O.K movies that people watch. It generates infinite O.K IDs. It
puts a bunch of people out of work and makes them obsolete. But it
doesn’t. It like deepens stagnation in some way. Is that a fear.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
那么，你是否担心一种可能的未来：AI本身在某种程度上变成了停滞的根源？它高度智能，却以一种循规蹈矩的方式进行创造。就像Netflix的算法，它制作出无数人们会看的“还行”的电影，生成无数“还行”的创意。它让一群人失业，让他们变得过时，但它并不能带来突破。它反而在某种程度上加深了停滞。这是一种担忧吗？

**Peter Thiel:** It’s like people just outsource. It’s quite possible
that that’s certainly a risk. But I guess where I end up is I still
think we should be trying. And that the alternative is just total
stagnation. So yeah, there’s all sorts of interesting things going to
happen with maybe drones in a military context are combined with AI and
O.K, this is kind of scary or dangerous or dystopian or it’s going to
change things. But if you don’t have AI, Wow, there’s just nothing going
on. And I don’t this is there’s a version of this discussion on the
internet where did the internet lead to more conformity and more
wokeness. And yeah, there are all sorts of ways where it didn’t lead to
quite the cornucopian diverse explosion of ideas that libertarians
fantasized about in 1999. But counterfactually, I would argue that it
was still better than the alternative, that if we hadn’t had the
internet, maybe it would have been worse. I bet it’s better than the
alternative. And the alternative is nothing at all. Because the.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
就像人们只是把思考外包了。这当然是一种风险，很有可能发生。但我想我最终的结论是，我们仍然应该去尝试。因为替代方案就是彻底的停滞。是的，未来会发生各种有趣的事情，也许无人机在军事上与AI结合，这有点吓人、危险或反乌托邦，但它会改变事物。可如果你没有AI，哇，那就什么都不会发生。关于互联网的讨论也有一个版本，即互联网是否导致了更多的顺从和“觉醒文化”。是的，在很多方面，它并没有带来自由主义者在1999年幻想的那种思想的丰饶和多元化大爆炸。但从反事实的角度看，我仍然认为它比替代方案要好。如果我们没有互联网，情况可能会更糟。我敢说它比替代方案好。而替代方案就是一无所有。

**Ross Douthat:** Look here’s one place where the stagnation arguments
are still reinforced. The fact that we’re only talking about I feel, is
always an implicit acknowledgment that. But for we are like in almost
total stagnation. But the world of A.I. is clearly filled with people
who at the very least seem to have a more utopian, transformative,
whatever word you want to call it view of the technology than you’re
expressing here.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
看，这里有一个地方，停滞论的观点仍然得到了加强。我觉得，我们只谈论AI这个事实，本身就是一种含蓄的承认，即除此之外，我们几乎处于完全停滞的状态。但AI世界里显然充满了这样的人，他们对这项技术的看法，至少看起来比你在这里表达的要更乌托邦、更具变革性，或者随便你怎么称呼。

## 超人类主义、不朽与基督教的野心

**Ross Douthat:** And you were mentioned earlier, the idea that the
modern world used to promise radical life extension and doesn’t anymore.
It seems very clear to me that a number of people deeply involved in
artificial intelligence see it as a kind of mechanism for transhumanism,
for transcendence of our mortal flesh, and either some kind of creation
of a successor species or some kind of merger of mind and machine. And
do you think that’s just all kind of irrelevant fantasy, or do you think
it’s just hype. Do you think people are trying to raise money by
pretending that we’re going to build a machine. God right. Is it hype.
Is it delusion. Is it something you worry about. I think you would. You
would prefer the human race to endure. You’re hesitating. Well, I Yes, I
would. This is a long hesitation.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
你之前提到，现代世界曾经承诺彻底延长生命，但现在不再了。在我看来很清楚，许多深度参与人工智能的人将其视为一种实现超人类主义
(transhumanism)
的机制，一种超越我们凡人肉体的途径，要么是创造某种后继物种，要么是实现心智与机器的融合。你认为这都只是无关紧要的幻想，还是仅仅是炒作？你认为人们是为了融资而假装我们要建造一个机器神吗？这是炒作吗？是妄想吗？还是你担心的事？我想你会……你会希望人类能够存续下去。你在犹豫。好吧，我……是的，我会。这是一个漫长的犹豫。

**Peter Thiel:** There’s a long hesitation. There’s so many questions.
And should the human race survive. Yes O.K. But I also would. I also
would like us to radically solve these problems. And so it’s always I
don’t know. Yeah transhumanism is this the ideal was this radical
transformation where your human natural body gets transformed into an
immortal body. And there’s a critique of let’s say, the trans people in
the sexual context or I don’t transvestite is someone who changes their
clothes and cross-dresses, and a transsexual is someone where you change
your I don’t penis into a vagina. And we can then debate how well those
surgeries work, but we want more transformation than that. It’s the
critique is not that it’s weird and unnatural. Man, it’s so pathetically
little. And we want more than cross-dressing or changing your sex
organs. We want you to be able to change your heart and change your mind
and change your whole body and then Orthodox Christianity. By the way,
the critique Orthodox Christianity has of these things don’t go far
enough like that. Transhumanism is just changing your body. But you also
need to transform your soul, and you need to transform your whole self.
And so.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
这是一个漫长的犹豫。问题太多了。人类应该存续下去吗？是的，好的。但我也希望……我也希望我们能从根本上解决这些问题。所以这总是……我不知道。是的，超人类主义的理想是这种激进的转变，你的自然人体转变为不朽的身体。有一种对……比如说，在性别语境下的跨性别者的批判。异装者是改变衣着、穿异性服装的人，而跨性别者是……我不知道，把阴茎变成阴道。我们可以辩论这些手术效果如何，但我们想要的转变远不止于此。批判的点不在于它奇怪或不自然，而在于它太微不足道了。我们想要的不仅仅是异装或改变性器官。我们希望你能改变你的心，改变你的思想，改变你的整个身体。顺便说一下，正统基督教对这些事情的批判是，它们走得还不够远。超人类主义只是改变你的身体，但你还需要转变你的灵魂，你需要转变你的整个自我。

**Ross Douthat:** But the other one. Wait wait wait, sorry, I generally
agree with your what I think is your belief that religion should be a
friend to science and ideas of scientific progress. I think any idea of
divine Providence has to encompass the fact that we have progressed and
achieved and done things that would have been unimaginable to our
ancestors. But it still also seems like, Yeah, the promise of
Christianity in the end is you get the perfected body and the perfected
soul through God’s grace. And the person who tries to do it on their own
with a bunch of machines is likely to end up as a dystopian character.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
但是，除了在座的各位，大多数致力于建造那个假设中的机器神的人，并不认为他们是在与耶和华、万军之主合作。他们认为自己是在凭一己之力建造不朽。

**Peter Thiel:** Yeah, right. We’re jumping around a lot. A lot of
things. So again the critique I was saying is they’re not ambitious
enough. From a Christian point of view, these people are not ambitious
enough. Now then we get into this question. Well, are they not. But
they’re not morally and spiritually ambitious enough. And are they. And
then are they are they still physically ambitious enough. And are they
are they even still really transhumanists? And this is where O.K. Man,
the cryonics thing that seems like a retro thing from 1999. There isn’t
that much of that going on. So they’re not transhumanists on a physical
body. And then, O.K, well, maybe it’s not about cryonics, maybe it’s
about uploading. O.K, well, it’s not quite. I’d rather have my body. I
don’t want just a computer program that simulates me. So that uploading
seems like a step down from cryonics, but. But then even that’s it’s
part of the conversation. And this is where it gets very hard to score.
And I don’t want to say they’re all making it up and it’s all fake, but
I don’t think you think some of it’s fake. I don’t think it’s fake
implies people are lying. But I want to say it’s not the center of
gravity. Yeah and so there is. Yeah, there is a cornucopian language.
There’s an optimistic language. A conversation I had with Elon a few
weeks ago about this was, he said, we’re going to have a billion
humanoid robots in the US in 10 years. And I said, well, if that’s true,
you don’t need to worry about the budget deficits because we’re going to
have so much growth. The growth will take care of this. And then. Well,
he’s still worried about the budget deficits. And then this doesn’t
prove that he doesn’t believe in the billion robots. But it suggests
that maybe he hasn’t thought it through or that he doesn’t think it’s
going to be as transformative economically or that there are big error
bars around it. But yeah, there’s some way in which these things are not
quite thought through. If I had to give a critique of Silicon Valley,
it’s always bad at what the meaning of tech is and the conversations,
they tend to go into this microscopic thing where it’s O.K, it’s like,
what are the IQ, Helo scores of the AI. And exactly how do you define
AGI. And we get into all these endless technical debates. And there are
a lot of questions that are at an intermediate level of meaning that
seem to me to be very important, which is like, what does it mean for
the budget deficit. What does it mean for the economy. What does it mean
for geopolitics.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
是的，我们跳跃得太快了。我刚才的批判是说他们不够有野心。从基督教的角度来看，这些人不够有野心。现在我们回到这个问题：他们在道德和精神上不够有野心，那他们在物理上还足够有野心吗？他们甚至还算是真正的超人类主义者吗？人体冷冻技术这东西感觉像是1999年的复古玩意儿，现在没那么多人搞了。所以他们在物理身体上不是超人类主义者。好吧，也许不是关于冷冻，是关于上传意识。但这也不太对。我宁愿要我的身体，不想要一个模拟我的计算机程序。所以上传意识似乎比冷冻技术还次一等。但即便如此，它也是对话的一部分。这就很难评判了。我不想说他们都在编造，都是假的，但我不认为……我认为有些是假的。我不认为“假的”意味着人们在撒谎，但我想说，它不是重心所在。是的，有一种丰饶的语言，一种乐观的语言。几周前我和埃隆的一次对话中，他说，我们将在10年内在美国拥有一亿个人形机器人。我说，嗯，如果那是真的，你就不用担心预算赤字了，因为我们将有如此多的增长，增长会解决这个问题。但他仍然担心预算赤字。这并不能证明他不相信那一亿个机器人，但它表明他可能没有想透，或者他不认为这在经济上会有那么大的变革性，或者这其中有很大的误差范围。是的，在某些方面，这些事情没有被完全想透。如果非要我对硅谷提出一个批评，那就是它总是搞不清楚科技的意义。对话往往陷入微观层面，比如，AI的智商、HELM得分是多少？你到底如何定义AGI（通用人工智能）？我们陷入了这些无休止的技术辩论。但有很多处于中间意义层面的问题，在我看来非常重要，比如，这对预算赤字意味着什么？对经济意味着什么？对地缘政治意味着什么？

**Peter Thiel:** One of the conversations, we had recently was and I had
was, does it change the calculus for China invading Taiwan, where we
have an accelerating AI revolution in the military. Is China falling
behind. And will this and maybe on the optimistic side, it deters China
because they’ve effectively lost. And on the pessimistic side it
accelerates them because they know it’s now or never. If they don’t grab
Taiwan now they will fall behind. And either way, this is a pretty
important thing. It’s not thought through. We don’t think about what AI
means for geopolitics. We don’t think about what it means for the macro
economy. And those are the kinds of questions I’d want us to push more。

**彼得·蒂尔:**
我们最近的一次对话是，鉴于我们在军事领域正在经历一场加速的AI革命，这是否改变了中国攻台的盘算？中国是否正在落后？这是否会……从乐观的角度看，这会威慑中国，因为他们实际上已经输了。而从悲观的角度看，这会加速他们的行动，因为他们知道机不可失，时不再来。如果他们现在不拿下台湾，他们就会落后。无论如何，这都是一个非常重要的事情。但没有被想透。我们不去思考AI对地缘政治意味着什么，不去思考它对宏观经济意味着什么。这些才是我希望我们能更多推动的问题。

## 敌基督、末日决战与对未来的两种恐惧

**Ross Douthat:** There’s also a very macroscopic question that you’re
interested in that, will pull on the religion thread a little bit here.
You have been giving talks recently about the concept of the Antichrist,
which is a Christian concept, an apocalyptic concept. What does that
mean to you. What is the antichrist?

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
还有一个你感兴趣的非常宏观的问题，这又会牵扯到宗教这条线。你最近一直在做关于“敌基督”(Antichrist)
概念的演讲，这是一个基督教的、末世论的概念。它对你意味着什么？什么是敌基督？

**Peter Thiel:** How much time do we have. We’ve got as long. As much
time as you have to talk about the Antichrist. All right, well, I have
A.I. could talk about it, but we’re near time. I mean, but no, I think
there’s always a question, how do we articulate some of these
existential risks, some of the challenges we have. And they’re all
framed in this runaway dystopian science texts. There’s a risk of
nuclear war. There’s a risk of environmental disaster. Maybe something
specific like climate change. Although there are lots of other ones we
could come up with. There’s a risk of I don’t know, bioweapons. You have
all the different sci-fi scenarios. Obviously, there are certain types
of risks with A.I. But I always think that if we’re going to have this
frame of talking about existential risks, perhaps we should also talk
about the risk of another type of a bad singularity, which I would
describe as the one world totalitarian state because I would say the
political solution, the default political solution people have for all
these existential risks is one world governance. What do you do about
nuclear weapons. We have a United Nations with real teeth that controls
them. And it’s they’re controlled by an international political order.
And then something like this is also, what do we do about A.I. and we
need global compute governance. We need a one world government to
control all the computers, log every single keystroke to make sure
people don’t program a dangerous A.I. And I’ve been wondering whether
that’s going from the frying pan into the fire. And so the atheist
philosophical framing is one world or none. That was a short film that
was put out by the Federation of American Scientists in the late 40s,
starts with a nuclear bomb blowing up the world. And obviously you need
a one world government to stop it, one world or none. And the Christian
framing, which in some ways is the same question, is Antichrist or
armageddon? You have the one world state of the Antichrist, or we’re
sleepwalking towards Armageddon. One world or none. Anti-christ or
Armageddon. On one level are the same. Question now, I have a lot of
thoughts on this topic, but one question is and this was a plot hole in
all these Antichrist books people wrote, how does the Antichrist take
over the world. He gives these demonic, hypnotic speeches and people
just fall for it. And so it’s this plot hole. It’s this demonic. It’s
totally it’s implausible. It’s a very implausible plot hole. But I think
we have an answer to this plot hole. The way the Antichrist would take
over the world is you talk about Armageddon non-stop, you talk about
existential risk non-stop. And this is what you need to regulate.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
我们有多少时间？我想谈多久都行。好吧，我可以让AI来谈这个，但我们时间快到了。我的意思是，我认为总有一个问题，我们如何阐述这些生存风险，我们面临的挑战。它们都被框定在失控的反乌托邦科学文本中。有核战争的风险，有环境灾难的风险，也许是像气候变化这样的具体问题，尽管我们还能想出很多其他的。还有生物武器的风险。你有所有不同的科幻场景。显然，AI也存在某些类型的风险。但我总觉得，如果我们要用这个框架来谈论生存风险，或许我们也应该谈论另一种糟糕的奇点风险，我称之为“单一世界极权国家”。因为我认为，人们对所有这些生存风险的默认政治解决方案，就是单一世界治理。如何处理核武器？我们建立一个有实权的联合国来控制它们，由一个国际政治秩序来管理。同样，我们如何处理AI？我们需要全球计算治理。我们需要一个单一世界政府来控制所有计算机，记录每一次按键，以确保人们不编程危险的AI。我一直在想，这是否是从油锅跳进了火坑。无神论的哲学框架是“一个世界，或一无所有”。这是40年代末美国科学家联合会发布的一部短片，开头就是一颗核弹炸毁了世界。显然，你需要一个单一世界政府来阻止它，“一个世界，或一无所有”。而基督教的框架，在某些方面是同一个问题，即“敌基督还是哈米吉多顿
(Armageddon：圣经中的末日决战)？”
你要么拥有敌基督的单一世界国家，要么我们正梦游般地走向哈米吉多顿。“一个世界，或一无所有”与“敌基督或哈米吉多顿”，在某种层面上是同一个问题。现在，关于这个话题我有很多想法，但一个问题是——这也是所有那些敌基督小说里的情节漏洞——敌基督是如何统治世界的？他发表那些恶魔般、催眠般的演讲，人们就信了。这就是情节漏洞。这太……这完全不可信。是一个非常不可信的情节漏洞。但我认为我们对这个情节漏洞有了一个答案。敌基督统治世界的方式，就是不停地谈论哈米吉多顿，不停地谈论生存风险。这就是你需要监管的东西。

**Peter Thiel:** It’s the opposite of the picture of baconian science
from the 17, 18th century, where the Antichrist is like some evil tech
genius, evil scientist who invents this machine to take over the world.
People are way too scared for that. In our world, the thing that has
political resonance is the opposite. It is. It is. The thing that has
political resonance is we need to stop science. We need to just say stop
to this. And this is where Yeah, I don’t know. In the 17th century, I
can imagine a Doctor Strangelove Edward Teller type person taking over
the world. In our world, it’s far more likely to be Greta Thunberg.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
这与17、18世纪培根式科学的图景恰恰相反。在那幅图景中，敌基督是某个邪恶的科技天才、邪恶的科学家，发明了机器来统治世界。现在的人们对此太过恐惧了。在我们的世界里，能引起政治共鸣的是相反的东西。能引起政治共鸣的是“我们需要停止科学”，“我们需要对这一切说不”。在这方面，我不知道，在17世纪，我可以想象一个“奇爱博士”爱德华·泰勒式的人物统治世界。但在我们的世界里，更有可能的是格蕾塔·通贝里。

**Ross Douthat:** O.K, I want to suggest a middle ground between those
two options. It used to be that the reasonable fear of the Antichrist
was a kind of Wizard of technology, and now the reasonable fear is
someone who promises to control technology, make it safe, and Usher in
what, from your point of view, would be a kind of universal stagnation.
Well, it’s more that’s more my description of how it would happen. So I
think people still have a fear of a 17th century anti-christ. We’re
still scared of Doctor Strangelove, right. But you’re saying you’re
saying the real Antichrist would play on that fear and say, you must
come with me to avoid Skynet, to avoid the Terminator, to avoid nuclear
armageddon? Yes And I guess my view would be looking at the world right
now, that you would need a certain kind of novel technological progress
to make that fear concrete. So I can buy that the world could turn to
someone who promised peace and regulation. If the world became convinced
that I was about to destroy everybody. But I think to get to that point,
you need one of the accelerationist apocalyptic scenarios to start to
play out to get your peace and safety anti-christ, you need more
technological progress. Like one of the key failures of totalitarianism
in the 20th century was it had a problem of knowledge. It couldn’t know
what was going on. All over in the world. So you need the A.I. or
whatever else to be capable of helping the peace and safety totalitarian
rule. So don’t you think you need essentially need your worst case
scenario to involve some burst of progress that is then tamed and used
to impose stagnant totalitarianism. You can’t just get there from where
we are right now.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
好的，我想在这两个选项之间提出一个中间地带。过去，对敌基督的合理恐惧是某种技术巫师；而现在，合理的恐惧是某人承诺控制技术、确保安全，并
usher
in（引入）一种从你的角度看是普遍停滞的状态。这更像是你对它如何发生的描述。我认为人们仍然对17世纪的敌基督心存恐惧。我们仍然害怕“奇爱博士”，对吧？但你的意思是，真正的敌基督会利用这种恐惧，说：“你必须跟我走，才能避免天网，避免终结者，避免核末日”？是的。我想我的看法是，看看当今世界，你需要某种新颖的技术进步才能让那种恐惧具体化。我可以接受，如果世界确信AI即将毁灭所有人，它可能会转向一个承诺和平与监管的人。但我认为要达到那一点，你需要一个加速主义的末日情景开始上演。为了得到你那个“和平与安全”的敌基督，你需要更多的技术进步。比如，20世纪极权主义的一个关键失败是它的知识问题，它无法知道世界各地正在发生什么。所以你需要AI或其他东西，能够帮助那个“和平与安全”的极权主义进行统治。所以，你难道不认为，你的最坏情景本质上需要包含一次进步的爆发，然后这种进步被驯服，并被用来强加停滞的极权主义吗？我们不可能从现在的位置直接跳到那里。

**Peter Thiel:** Well, it can Greta Thunberg’s on a boat in the
Mediterranean. Protesting Israel the. I just don’t see the promise of
safety from A.I., safety from tech safety, even safety from climate
change right now as a powerful universal rallying cry. Absent
accelerating change and real fear of total catastrophe.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
嗯，格蕾塔·通贝里正在地中海的一艘船上抗议以色列。我只是不认为，在没有加速变化和对彻底灾难的真实恐惧的情况下，“免受AI威胁的安全”、“免受技术威胁的安全”，甚至是“免受气候变化威胁的安全”现在能成为一个强有力的、普世的集结号。

**Ross Douthat:** I mean, these things are so hard to score, but I think
environmentalism is pretty powerful. I don’t know if it’s I don’t know
if it’s absolutely powerful enough to create a one world totalitarian
state. But man, it is. I think it is not. It is in its current form. It
is. I want to say it’s the only thing people still believe in Europe.
They believe in the green thing more than Islamic Sharia law or more
than in the Chinese Communist totalitarian takeover. And the future is
an idea of a future that looks different from the present. The only
three on offer in Europe are green, Sharia and the totalitarian
Communist state. And the green one is by far the strongest and in a
declining, decaying Europe.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
但它在世界上不是主导力量。它总是在特定的背景下。然后，我不知道，我们与核技术的发展有着非常复杂的历史。我们没有……是的，我们没有真正走向一个极权的单一世界国家。但到了1970年代，关于停滞的一种解释是，技术的失控进步变得非常可怕，培根式的科学在阿拉莫斯（核武器研发地）终结了。然后就……它就在那里结束了。我们不想要更多了。当查尔斯·曼森在60年代末服用LSD并开始杀人时，他在LSD中看到和学到的是，你可以像陀思妥耶夫斯基笔下的反英雄一样，一切都是被允许的。当然，不是每个人都成了查尔斯·曼森。但历史上至关重要的一点是，不是每个人都变得像查尔斯·曼森一样疯狂。查尔斯·曼森并没有成为敌基督并统治世界。我们正在以末日论结束这场对话。

**Ross Douthat:** No, but you’re my telling of the. My telling of the
history of the 1970s is the hippies did win and they. But we landed. We
landed on the moon in July of 1969. Woodstock started three weeks later.
And with the benefit of hindsight, that’s when progress stopped and the
hippies won. And yeah, it was not literally Charles Manson. But you’re
just I want to stay with the Antichrist just to end. Because and you’re
retreating, you’re saying, O.K environmentalism is already pro
stagnation and so on. O.K, let’s agree with all that. I’m just saying
we’re not living under we’re not living under the Antichrist right now.
We’re just stagnant. And you’re positing that something worse could be
on the horizon. That would make stagnation permanent. That would be
driven by fear. And I’m suggesting that for that to happen, there would
have to be some burst of technological progress that was akin to Alamos
that people are afraid of. And I guess this is my very specific question
for you, right. Is that, well, you are you’re an investor in A.I. You’re
deeply invested in Palantir, in military technology and technologies, of
surveillance and technologies of warfare and so on. And it just seems to
me that when you tell me a story about the Antichrist coming to power
and using the fear of technological change to impose order on the world,
I feel like that Antichrist would maybe be using the tools that you
were, that you were building. Wouldn’t the Antichrist be like, great
we’re not going to have any more technological progress. But I really
like what Palantir has done so far right. I mean, isn’t that a concern.
Wouldn’t that be the irony of history would be that the man publicly
worrying about the Antichrist accidentally hastens his or her arrival.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
看，有所有这些不同的情景。我显然不认为我正在做那样的事。需要明确的是，我也不认为你正在做那样的事。我只是好奇，世界是如何愿意屈服于永久的威权统治的。好吧，但同样，我们可以描述这个问题的不同层次。但我刚才告诉你的，作为一个对过去50年停滞的宽泛解释，即整个世界为了和平与安全而屈服，这真的那么荒谬吗？这是《帖撒罗尼迦前书》5章3节。敌基督的口号是“和平与安全”。我们已经屈服了。FDA不仅监管美国的药品，事实上也监管全世界的药品，因为世界其他地方都听从FDA。核管理委员会有效地监管着全世界的核电站。你不能设计一个模块化核反应堆就在阿根廷建造。他们不会信任阿根廷的监管机构，他们会听从美国的。所以，这至少是一个关于我们为什么有50年停滞的问题。一个答案是我们耗尽了思想。另一个答案是文化上发生了某些变化，使其不被允许。这个文化上的答案可以是一个自下而上的答案，即人类转变为了一种更温顺的物种；也可以至少部分是自上而下的，即政府这台机器被改造成了这台停滞机器。我认为像核能这样的东西，本应是21世纪的能源，但它不知何故在全世界范围内被搁置了。所以从某种意义上说，按照这种说法，我们已经生活在敌基督的温和统治之下了。你认为上帝在掌控历史吗？

**Peter Thiel:** I mean, this is again A.I. think there’s always room
for human freedom and human choice. These things are or at least where
we are today. These things are they’re not absolutely predetermined one
way or another. But God wouldn’t leave us forever under the rule of a
mild, moderate Antichrist, right. That can’t be how the story ends,
right.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
我认为总是有着人类自由和人类选择的空间。这些事情……至少在我们今天所处的位置，它们并非绝对地被预先决定。但上帝不会让我们永远生活在一个温和的、中庸的敌基督的统治之下，对吧？故事不可能是这样结局的，对吧？

**Ross Douthat:** It’s attributing too much causation to God is always a
problem. I know there are different Bible verses I can give you, but
I’ll give you John 1525 where Christ says, they hated me without cause
and so as all these people that are persecuting Christ have no reason,
no cause for why they’re persecuting Christ, and if we interpret this as
a ultimate causation verse, they want to say, I’m persecuting because
God caused me to do this. God is causing everything. And the Christian
view is anti-calvinist. God is not behind history. God is not causing
everything. If you say God is causing everything, but God is. But wait.
But God is. You’re scapegoating God, but God is your scapegoat. But God
is behind Jesus Christ entering history because God was not going to
leave us in a stagnation as decadent Roman Empire, right.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
将过多的因果关系归于上帝总是个问题。我知道我可以给你不同的圣经经文，但我会给你《约翰福音》15章25节，基督说：“他们无故地恨我”。所以所有这些迫害基督的人都没有理由，没有原因。如果我们把这解读为终极因果的经文，他们会想说：“我迫害是因为上帝让我这么做。上帝导致了一切。”而基督教的观点是反加尔文主义的。上帝不在历史背后。上帝不导致一切。如果你说上帝导致一切……但等等，但上帝……你是在把上帝当替罪羊。但上帝是耶稣基督进入历史的幕后推手，因为上帝不会把我们留在像颓废的罗马帝国那样的停滞中，对吧？

**Peter Thiel:** Well, so at some point, at some point, no, no, at some
point God is going to step in. I am not, I am not, I am not that
Calvinist. And that’s not Calvinism, though. That’s just Christianity.
God God will not leave us eternally staring into screens and being
lectured by Greta Thunberg, right. He will not abandon us to that fate.

**彼得·蒂尔:**
嗯，在某个时刻，在某个时刻，不，不，在某个时刻上帝会介入的。我不是……我不是那么加尔文主义。但那不是加尔文主义，那只是基督教。上帝不会让我们永远盯着屏幕，被格蕾塔·通贝里说教，对吧？他不会把我们遗弃给那种命运。

**Ross Douthat:** It is. It is. There is a great, I don’t know, for
better and for worse. I think there’s a great deal of scope for human
action, for human freedom. If I thought these things were deterministic,
you might as well maybe just accept it. The lines are coming. You should
just have some yoga and prayerful meditation and wait while the lines
eat you up. And I don’t think that’s what you’re supposed to do.

**罗斯·杜塔特:**
是的。无论是好是坏，我认为人类行动和人类自由有很大的空间。如果我认为这些事情是命中注定的，你或许就干脆接受它。狮子要来了，你就做做瑜伽，虔诚地冥想，等着狮子把你吃掉。但我不认为这是你应该做的。

**Ross Douthat:** It’s no, I agree with that. And I think on that note,
I’m just trying to be hopeful and suggesting that in trying to resist
the Antichrist using your human freedom, you should have hope that
you’ll succeed. We can agree on that.

**彼得·蒂尔:** 好的。彼得·蒂尔，感谢你加入我。

**罗斯·杜塔特:** 谢谢你。
