            <h1>不争总统争“未来”：马斯克“美国党”想振兴的不止美国</h1>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Musk announced the establishment of his own political party, the "American Party", to challenge the two-party system in the United States. He had just parted ways with the Democratic Party and broke up with Trump when he did this, which was as difficult as sending humans to Mars. It was ridiculous to establish a third party, but he wanted to change more than just the United States. For him, really taking over the American regime must be too small a goal for him.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 马斯克宣布成立自己的政党——“美国党”（American Party），意图挑战美国的两党制。他刚与民主党分道扬镳，又和特朗普闹掰，此时另立山头，其难度不亚于将人类送上火星。成立第三党看似荒诞，但他想改变的，可能远不止美国。对他而言，真正接管美国政权这个目标，格局恐怕太小了。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Hello everyone, I am Chen Qian. This is the 101 weekly video, let's talk about how the American Party announced by Musk will change the political landscape of the United States. The discussion will become more and more interesting as time goes on. Everyone should watch it to the end.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 大家好，我是陈茜。这里是101 Weekly视频，我们来聊一聊马斯克宣布的“美国党”将如何改变美国的政治格局。接下来的讨论会越来越有趣，大家一定要看到最后。</p>

            <h2>一、马斯克的动机：不为“中间派”，只为“未来派”</h2>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> First of all, let's talk about Musk's motivation for establishing the "American Party". In fact, it is very simple and direct. He opposes the political platforms of both sides.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 首先，我们来谈谈马斯克成立“美国党”的动机。其实非常简单直接：他反对两党的政治纲领。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> For the Democratic Party, he criticized the so-called "awakening culture" and the increasingly left-leaning "political correctness" and "speech censorship" in recent years. He believes that the Democratic Party has too strong regulation on technology, hinders innovation, and openly opposes too radical tax increases.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 对于民主党，他批评其所谓的“觉醒文化”（awakening culture），以及近年来日益左倾的“政治正确”和“言论审查”。他认为民主党对科技监管过强，阻碍了创新，并公开反对过于激进的增税方案。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> For the Republican Party, although it is closer to Musk's preferences in tax cuts and market freedom , the platform advocated by the Republican Party on many key issues is still far from Musk's values. In the end, Musk, who contributed money and effort in the general election, parted ways with Trump because of the differences over the "big and beautiful" bill.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 对于共和党，尽管在减税和市场自由方面更接近马斯克的偏好，但共和党在许多关键议题上主张的纲领，仍与马斯克的价值观相去甚远。最终，曾在大选中出钱出力的马斯克，因在“又大又美”（Big and Beautiful）法案上的分歧与特朗普分道扬镳。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> After breaking up with both sides, he personally went out to establish a political party. This is also very consistent with Musk's usual style.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 在与两党都闹掰后，他亲自下场成立政党，这也非常符合马斯克一贯的行事风格。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Our interview guests believe that it was not "big and beautiful" that made Musk determined to establish the "American Party". The impact of the "American Party" bill on Tesla's energy subsidies is really because Musk believes that this bill will harm the future of the United States. I tend to believe that Musk will not just be hurt by his own interests, but more because the future he believes in has been impacted.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 我们的受访嘉宾认为，促使马斯克下定决心成立“美国党”的，并非“又大又美”法案对特斯拉能源补贴的影响，而是因为马斯克认为这个法案将损害美国的未来。我更倾向于相信，马斯克并非仅仅因为自身利益受损，更多的是因为他所信奉的未来遭到了冲击。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Although Musk posted on X that someone is needed to represent the "centrists" in the United States, it is possible that the "American Party" that Musk wants to create will ultimately not represent the "centrists" he mentioned, but the "futurists."</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 尽管马斯克在X上发文称，需要有人来代表美国的“中间派”，但马斯克想打造的“美国党”，最终代表的可能并非他口中的“中间派”，而是“未来派”。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Musk does not represent the middle. The left, right and middle we talk about are all referring to the present , and Musk's vision is completely towards the future. It's just that although his vision is towards the future, his body is still in the present. His body has to tear with the current left and right.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 马斯克代表的不是中间。我们谈论的左、右、中，都指向的是“现在”，而马斯克的视野完全朝向“未来”。只是，尽管他的视野朝向未来，但他的身体仍在现在。他的身体必须与当下的左派和右派进行博弈。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Regardless of whether Musk is just because of energy subsidies or he does have a greater belief that the debt problem will crush the current situation in the United States in the future, it is because of this bill that he and Trump turned against each other.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 不论马斯克是单纯因为能源补贴，还是他确实怀有更宏大的信念，认为债务问题将在未来压垮美国的现状，正是因为这个法案，他与特朗普反目成仇。</p>

            <h2>二、“美国党”的成功几率有多大？</h2>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> So let's talk about the chances of success of the "American Party"? In the United States, the "two-party system" formed by the Democratic Party and the Republican Party in the past few decades is very difficult to break. There are three reasons for this.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 那么，“美国党”的成功几率有多大？在美国，过去几十年来由民主党和共和党构成的“两党制”是极难被打破的。这背后有三个原因。</p>

            <h3>障碍一：选举制度</h3>
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> The first is the U.S. electoral system. Most state elections in the United States adopt the "single-member district, most votes win" system, which is the so-called "winner takes all".</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 第一个原因是美国的选举制度。美国大多数州选举采用“单一选区，多数票获胜”制，也就是所谓的“赢者通吃”（winner takes all）。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> For example, in California, which has 54 electoral votes, the Democratic Party gets 50.1% of the votes and the Republican Party gets 49.9% of the votes. Then, at the presidential election level, if the Democratic presidential candidate wins all 54 electoral votes in California, the Republican Party will get zero, not to mention a third party, and there will be no chance at all.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 举例来说，在拥有54张选举人票的加州，假设民主党获得50.1%的选票，共和党获得49.9%，那么在总统选举层面，民主党总统候选人将赢得加州全部54张选举人票，而共和党将一无所获，更不用说第三党，根本毫无机会。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Similarly, the Senate has 100 seats, two seats in each state for a term of six years, and about one-third of the seats are re-elected every two years. The "winner takes all" system is also adopted during the election. Even if the Republican Party gets 49.9% of the votes, the corresponding seats will all go to the Democratic Party.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 同样，参议院有100个席位，每州两席，任期六年，每两年改选约三分之一。选举时也采用“赢者通吃”制。即使共和党获得49.9%的选票，相应的席位也将全部归于民主党。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> The House of Representatives is slightly different. There are a total of 435 seats, of which California has 52 seats based on population. Each seat is a specific constituency in the state. The participating parties in this constituency each elect a representative with the most votes. So even in California, a Democratic stronghold , there may be seats for the Republicans and third parties in the House of Representatives.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 众议院则稍有不同。总共有435个席位，其中加州根据人口拥有52席。每个席位代表州内一个特定的选区，该选区内的参选政党各推一名代表，得票最多者当选。因此，即使在民主党的大本营加州，共和党和第三党在众议院也可能获得席位。</p>

            <h3>马斯克的策略：“以小博大”</h3>
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> So as long as the rules of the game are still "winner takes all", it will be very difficult for third parties to win the presidential and Senate elections. In other words, Musk's "American Party" does not aim to become the ruling party but to win as many seats as possible. When the Democratic and Republican votes are close, Musk can "fight big with small" to change the fate of some bills. At this time, his importance is highlighted.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 所以，只要游戏规则仍然是“赢者通吃”，第三党就很难在总统和参议院选举中获胜。换句话说，马斯克“美国党”的目标可能并非成为执政党，而是赢得尽可能多的席位。当民主党和共和党票数接近时，马斯克就能“以小博大”，改变一些法案的命运。此时，他的重要性便凸显出来。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> At present, he himself has also (set) a more limited goal, that is, to win two or three seats in the Senate and 8 to 10 seats in the House of Representatives. Take the "Big and Beautiful" bill as an example. The voting results when it passed the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22 After 215 votes in favor and 214 votes against, the revised version of the bill was passed in the Senate on July 1 with 51 votes in favor and 50 votes against. Note that the two parties were actually tied here with 50 votes each, and Vice President Vance, as the "Speaker of the Senate", cast the decisive vote. Two days later, on July 3, the House of Representatives passed the Senate's revised bill with 218 votes in favor and 214 votes against.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 目前，他自己也设定了一个较为有限的目标，即在参议院赢得两到三个席位，在众议院赢得八到十个席位。以“又大又美”法案为例，5月22日在美国众议院通过时的投票结果是215票赞成对214票反对。7月1日，该法案的修订版在参议院以51票赞成对50票反对通过。值得注意的是，当时两党实际上是50票对50票打平，由副总统（此处应为贺锦丽 Harris）作为“参议院议长”投下了决定性的一票。两天后的7月3日，众议院以218票赞成对214票反对通过了参议院的修订法案。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> So you can see that in the face of such a controversial bill, the power of the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress is very equal, and one vote can change the direction of the whole thing. So think about it, if Musk's "American Party" has seats in Congress, whether in the House of Representatives or the Senate, Musk's voice is actually quite large and can play a decisive role The key "vote division" effect is at the level of the House of Representatives. The East and West Coasts have a greater chance.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 所以你可以看到，在面对这样一个充满争议的法案时，民主党和共和党在国会的力量非常均衡，一票之差就能改变整个事态的走向。那么想一想，如果马斯克的“美国党”在国会拥有席位，无论是在众议院还是参议院，马斯克的话语权其实相当大，能够起到决定性的关键“分票”作用，尤其是在众议院层面，东西海岸的机会更大。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> But there is a contradiction here. In fact, Musk is likely to divide the votes for the Republican Party at present, but the East and West Coasts are Democratic strongholds. So this requires more (detailed) political calculations. He looks for a few small constituencies in the Democratic strongholds. Maybe some small constituencies are Republican. Then I will pry those small constituencies away. This requires very political calculations.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 但这里存在一个矛盾：实际上，马斯克目前很可能会分走共和党的选票，但东西海岸却是民主党的大本营。所以这就需要更精细的政治算计。他在民主党大本营里寻找几个小选区，可能某些小选区是共和党的，然后他去撬动那些小选区。这需要非常高明的政治计算。</p>

            <h3>障碍二与三：选民心理与资源不均</h3>
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> We say that the "two-party system" is difficult to break for three reasons. The above electoral system is the first reason. The second reason is the psychology of voters. Because everyone knows that the third-party candidate has little chance, but they are afraid of "wasting votes", so they have to start from "the The third reason is that resources are unequal. The US election is a very time-consuming , labor-intensive and costly affair. The Democratic and Republican parties have decades of roots and connections across the country. The donation and canvassing network is very mature, while the third party lacks fundraising channels, cannot get media exposure and has no grassroots mobilization.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 我们说“两党制”难破有三个原因，上面讲的选举制度是第一个。第二个原因是选民心理。因为大家都知道第三党候选人机会渺茫，又怕“浪费选票”，所以不得不从……第三个原因是资源不平等。美国选举是一件非常耗时、耗力、耗钱的事情。民主党和共和党在全国有几十年的根基和人脉，捐款和拉票网络非常成熟，而第三党则缺乏筹款渠道，得不到媒体曝光，也没有基层动员能力。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> But some people think that the times have changed. Musk himself is the world's richest man and a super IP. Maybe he can reverse the third factor?</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 但有人认为，时代已经变了。马斯克本人是世界首富，又是一个超级IP，或许他能扭转第三个因素？</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> They (the previous third party) can only create a certain momentum during the election. But it is still too early to truly form (influence). However, Musk is different from them because we can see that, for example, Trump’s coming to power this time, in a sense, was not the operation of a political party, but the operation of a super IP. In the era of social media, the influence of a super IP and the political energy it can breed may be far greater than a political issue and greater than a certain political party. And Musk is undoubtedly also a super IP.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 以前的第三党只能在选举期间制造一定的声势，但要真正形成影响力还为时过早。然而，马斯克与他们不同。因为我们可以看到，例如这次特朗普的上台，在某种意义上并非一个政党的运作，而是一个超级IP的运作。在社交媒体时代，一个超级IP的影响力及其能孕育的政治能量，可能远大于一个政治议题，也大于某个政党。而马斯克无疑也是一个超级IP。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> So I think he is compared with the Green Party and the Tea Party. Those are all certain political issues. They don’t have super IPs. In the era of social media, their opportunities are different. So if Musk’s "American Party" is really established, how much influence it can have, we will have to wait and see.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 所以我认为，他与绿党、茶党相比，那些都只是某些政治议题，它们没有超级IP。在社交媒体时代，他们的机会是不同的。因此，如果马斯克的“美国党”真的成立，能有多大影响力，我们还需拭目以待。</p>

            <h2>三、终极目标：为AI时代的“再中世纪化”做准备？</h2>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> In the last part of this video, let’s open our minds. When I was chatting with Professor Shi Zhan, he raised a level that I hadn’t thought of before, which is why Musk had to get involved in politics. This is also puzzling to many people. You already have so many companies under your name. Why don’t you just build cars, driverless cars, and go to Mars? Why do you have to set up a political party and create so many enemies?</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 在视频的最后一部分，让我们打开思路。当我与施展教授聊天时，他提出了一个我之前未曾想到的层面，那就是马斯克为什么要涉足政治。这也让很多人感到困惑：你名下已经有这么多公司，为什么不专心造车、搞无人驾驶、去火星，而非要成立一个政党，树立这么多敌人呢？</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Professor Shi Zhan has a point of view. He said that when AI develops rapidly, human society will face a very big change in order. The gap between the rich and the poor may widen further. This will make the already extreme forces and factions even more extreme. At that time, a new political form will be needed, and Musk is preparing for this future.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 施展教授有一个观点。他说，当AI高速发展时，人类社会将面临一场巨大的秩序变革，贫富差距可能进一步拉大，这将使得本已极端的势力和派别更加极端。到那时，将需要一种新的政治形态，而马斯克正在为这个未来做准备。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Politics will of course change. The present (political situation) will no longer fit (applicable) to the future. And it's not just politics. I have been thinking about this issue recently. The series of social logic, legal logic, and ethical concept systems that we are familiar with and adapted to are likely to change.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 政治当然会变。现在的政治状况将不再适用于未来。而且不仅仅是政治。我最近一直在思考这个问题，我们所熟悉和适应的一系列社会逻辑、法律逻辑、伦理观念体系，都可能发生变化。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> In the feudal society , people's productivity was relatively low and the total amount of wealth was small. If you still want to be able to establish order, there must be a very small number of people accumulating a large proportion of wealth. Under this state, how can you prevent the extremely terrible class struggle? It is very simple. The property of the nobles does not just serve the needs of the nobles. This property right is attached with a series of obligations. The nobles have to take care of the birth, aging, illness and death of the vassals and even the serfs under him. If you don't care, you are not qualified to be a noble. All the nobles will look down on you and think you are not worthy. At this time, this property right is different from what we understand today.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 在封建社会，人们的生产力较低，财富总量很小。如果你还想能够建立秩序，就必须有极少数人积累大部分财富。在这种状态下，如何防止极其可怕的阶级斗争？很简单，贵族的财产不仅仅服务于贵族的需求，这项财产权附带了一系列的义务。贵族必须照顾他手下的封臣乃至农奴的生老病死。如果你不管，你就不配做贵族，所有贵族都会看不起你，认为你不配。此时，这种财产权与我们今天所理解的是不同的。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> But if the various responsibilities, rights and obligations on your property rights are so complicated, it will definitely inhibit your transaction efficiency. So after the Great Revolution, the establishment of the French Civil Code, etc., it finally made this property right cleaner and more efficient. The transaction efficiency can be greatly improved, and there will be no more problems before. Why can this property right stand at this time? Because the French Revolution was also taking place at the same time, the British Industrial Revolution was also taking place, and a lot of wealth emerged. So in this case, you don't need to own such a large proportion of wealth to maintain public order. You use a relatively small proportion of wealth. Because the total amount increases, then your proportion becomes smaller, and your control is still enough to support public order.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 但如果你的财产权上附加了如此复杂的各种责任、权利和义务，就一定会抑制你的交易效率。所以在大革命之后，《法国民法典》等的建立，最终使得这种财产权变得更纯粹、更有效率。交易效率可以大大提高，以前的问题就不再存在了。为什么此时这种财产权能够成立？因为法国大革命的同时，英国工业革命也在发生，大量的财富涌现出来。所以在这种情况下，你不需要拥有那么大比例的财富来维持公共秩序。你用一个相对较小比例的财富，因为总量增加了，那么你的比例变小了，你的控制力也仍然足以支撑公共秩序。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> But in the future, after the emergence of AI, this kind of work form today will definitely disappear. In the future, a new work form will evolve, but what is that work form? We still can't imagine it now. Even if there is such a work model, you can't compare with Sam Altman. The wealth gap between you and him may be much greater than the wealth gap between you and Bill Gates now. And the concentration of wealth will be much greater than today. If you make an analogy from the perspective of wealth concentration, it is a bit like returning to the state of the Middle Ages.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 但在未来，AI出现之后，今天这种工作形态肯定会消失。未来会演化出一种新的工作形态，但那是什么样的形态？我们现在还无法想象。即便有那样的工作模式，你也无法与萨姆·奥特曼（Sam Altman）相提并论。你和他之间的财富差距，可能远大于现在你和比尔·盖茨之间的差距。而且财富的集中度将远大于今天。如果从财富集中的角度做类比，这有点像回到了中世纪的状态。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Once it reaches that state, it may cause an unprecedented class confrontation between the two classes, and this class confrontation may completely tear the society apart. It is more terrible than the tearing today. But how did we deal with this problem when we look back at the history of the Middle Ages? It's very simple. The superior has a series of other responsibilities attached to your property rights. So the future may return to this situation again.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 一旦达到那种状态，可能会引发两个阶级之间前所未有的阶级对抗，而这种对抗可能会彻底撕裂社会，比今天的撕裂更可怕。但我们回顾中世纪历史，是如何处理这个问题的？很简单，上层阶级的财产权上附带了一系列其他的责任。所以未来可能再次回到这种情况。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> For example, Sam Altman and Huang are super rich, but their property rights are of course I am just using them as an analogy, not really these two people. Those who are in power above AI in the future will also have a series of responsibilities for the super wealth in their hands, just like the nobles in the Middle Ages had to bear a series of responsibilities for their vassals. And this series of responsibilities may be presented in the form of UBI (universal basic income). I don’t think UBI should be issued by the state, but by these tycoons. And these tycoons issue UBI in the form of digital currency. Then in the future AI era, more than half of the economic activities may be completed on the chain. Then, when UBI is issued with digital currency, the logic of transaction medium, payment medium, etc. will naturally be able to go on.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 例如，萨姆·奥特曼和黄仁勋（Jen-Hsun Huang）是超级富豪，但他们的财产权——当然我只是用他们做类比，并非特指这两人——未来掌握AI权力的那些人，他们手中的超级财富也将附带一系列责任，就像中世纪的贵族必须为其封臣承担一系列责任一样。而这一系列责任，可能会以全民基本收入（UBI, Universal Basic Income）的形式呈现。我不认为UBI应该由国家来发放，而应由这些科技巨头发放。并且这些巨头以数字货币的形式发放UBI。那么在未来的AI时代，一半以上的经济活动可能都在链上完成。那么，当UBI以数字货币发放时，交易媒介、支付媒介等逻辑自然就能走通了。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> And once that step is reached, there will be a very important evolution. I call it all-round re-medievalization. Then in the future, with the large-scale development of a series of new technologies such as AI, blockchain, etc., each country will be like the lords of the year, and all of these are these large models, these networks, these series of main blocks. The chain will become a global infrastructure, forming a new economic space beyond the lords. At that point, the political and economic spaces will be completely and thoroughly separated from each other and become two parallel spaces.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 一旦走到那一步，将会有一个非常重要的演化，我称之为全方位的“再中世纪化”（re-medievalization）。未来，随着AI、区块链等一系列新科技的大规模发展，每个国家就像当年的领主，而所有这些大模型、这些网络、这些主链，将成为全球性的基础设施，形成一个超越于领主之外的新的经济空间。到那时，政治空间和经济空间将彻底地、完全地相互分离，成为两个平行的空间。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> In this sense, it will once again attach importance to planning. Then, for an ordinary citizen, your body is in the political space, but many of your resources and benefits do come from the economic space. When the economic space bullies you, you can turn to the political space for help to counterattack, and when the political space bullies you, you can turn to the economic space for help to counterattack. A mutual check and balance state is possible.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 从这个意义上说，它将再次重视规划。那么，对于一个普通公民来说，你的身体在政治空间里，但你的许多资源和福利确实来自经济空间。当经济空间欺负你时，你可以求助于政治空间来反击；而当政治空间欺负你时，你又可以求助于经济空间来反击。一种相互制衡的状态是可能实现的。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> In fact, we mentioned earlier that the top Tycoons will distribute them in the form of UBI in the future. First of all, Ultraman mentioned that everyone should have basic computing power in the future. This is similar to computing power in the future, which is money. This is equivalent to starting to do it. They are all thinking about this. And soon after Musk announced the establishment of the American Party, he had various interactions with Andrew Yang. Andrew Yang has been talking about the issue of UBI. I think they are indeed moving in this direction.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 实际上，我们前面提到顶尖的科技巨头未来会以UBI的形式进行分配。首先，奥特曼（Sam Altman）就提到，未来每个人都应该拥有基本的算力，这类似于未来的算力就是金钱。这相当于他们已经开始在做了，他们都在思考这个问题。而且在马斯克宣布成立“美国党”后不久，他就与杨安泽（Andrew Yang）进行了各种互动。杨安泽一直在谈论UBI的问题。我认为他们确实在朝着这个方向前进。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Isn't this a very mind-blowing part? When I was listening to Professor Shi Zhan's talk, I thought it was too hard to imagine. But at the same time, I felt that when AI replaces humans on a large scale to carry out tasks, I don't know whether the society at that time will evolve into that in our lifetime or in Musk's lifetime. It will indeed face a very different social form, wealth distribution method and order. This is very similar to the scene in the cyberpunk era. I believe Musk has very deep thoughts on this. It is not ruled out that the current "American Party" is paving the way for the future "Future Party".</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 这部分是不是非常颠覆认知？当我在听施展教授讲的时候，我觉得这太难以想象了。但同时我又觉得，当AI大规模替代人类去执行任务时，我不知道我们有生之年或者马斯克有生之年，那个社会是否会演变成那样。它确实将面临一个非常不同的社会形态、财富分配方式和秩序。这与赛博朋克（cyberpunk）时代的情景非常相似。我相信马斯克对此有非常深入的思考，不排除现在的“美国党”是在为未来的“未来党”铺路。</p>
