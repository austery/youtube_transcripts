            <h1>深度分析：泳池用品店是骗局吗？</h1>
            
            <h2>问题的根源：认知差距与行业现实</h2>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Are swimming pool stores a ripoff? Like, what's the deal with that? I think most pool owners are familiar with hearing that about swimming pool stores that you got to be careful because they're going to rip you off and sell you a bunch of stuff that you don't need.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 泳池用品店是骗局吗？这到底是怎么回事？我想大多数泳池主人都听过这样的说法：要小心泳池用品店，因为他们会敲你竹杠，卖给你一堆你不需要的东西。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> I think there are two things. There's two things that cause this problem. And the first one, we'll just call it what it is. You don't know enough about pool water chemistry. If you knew enough about pool water chemistry, nobody could sell you anything. You would arrive to pick up exactly what you need. You would pick up what you need and then you would leave. Maybe buy a big inflatable unicorn. I don't know. But you wouldn't be sold a bunch of expensive pool chemicals that you don't really need cuz you know exactly what's going on.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 我认为有两个因素导致了这个问题。第一个，我们就实话实说吧：你对泳池水化学 (pool water chemistry：指维持泳池水质平衡所需的一系列化学参数和处理方法) 的了解不够。如果你了解得足够多，就没人能卖给你任何东西。你会直接去拿你所需要的东西，然后离开。或许顺便买个巨大的充气独角兽，谁知道呢。但你绝不会被推销一堆你根本不需要的昂贵化学品，因为你清楚地知道水质的状况。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> And I'm not talking about like, oh, you need to be a chemist to be able to do this. You need to know like eight things. You need to not even understand them. You just need to memorize these eight things and know that you got to be in the this range. If one of these things is not in the range, you got to fix that thing. And there's an order of operations. That's it. I just summarize the whole deal. You could you could learn it over a bottle of wine if you tried hard enough. It's not that hard to do.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 我不是说你需要成为化学家才能做到。你只需要了解大约八项指标。你甚至不需要完全理解它们，只需记住这八项指标，并知道它们必须保持在某个范围内。如果其中一项不在范围内，你就去修复它。并且这其中有一个操作顺序 (order of operations：指调整水质化学参数时必须遵循的特定步骤，以避免相互干扰)。就是这么简单，我把整个事情都概括了。如果你用心，喝一瓶红酒的功夫就能学会。这并不难。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> And considering the benefits to you for the rest of your life owning this pool, you can't pull the wool over your eyes anymore. And there's no more of this like uncertainty and worry that you're doing things wrong or is this working? Am I creating a problem here? You can just put all of that to bed by learning some basic pool water chemistry. Nobody sells you anything you don't need anymore.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 考虑到拥有这个泳池将在你余生中给你带来的好处，你不能再被人蒙蔽了。你也不再需要为自己是否做错、方法是否有效、是否在制造新问题而感到不确定和担忧。通过学习一些基础的泳池水化学知识，你可以彻底消除所有这些烦恼。再也没有人能卖给你不需要的东西了。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> So, what's that other problem that we're talking about here that gives this reputation that pool stores are a bunch of jerks and they're going to sell you things you don't need? Well, I mean, it's a business. First of all, they want to make money. Granted, I think and I maybe I can only speak to my area, you know, I only have the my own experience to to draw from here to answer this question, but in my area, the largest pool stores have the most turnover of staff or they just need the most staff, right?</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 那么，我们所说的另一个问题是什么呢？是什么让泳池用品店背上了“都是些混蛋，只会卖你不需要的东西”这样的名声？嗯，首先，这是门生意，他们想赚钱。当然，我可能只能以我所在地区的经验来回答这个问题，但在我这里，最大的泳池用品店往往有最高的员工流失率 (turnover of staff：指在特定时期内员工离开公司的比率)，或者说他们只是需要最多的员工，对吧？</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> So, you have like, I don't know, a hundred new people you have to train every year to be pool water chemistry specialists. That's hard to do. Like if you're a small company, you need like three people on staff on a rotating schedule that understand pool water chemistry. When you're a great big store, you unless you have some like amazing in-house built training program for bringing in summer students, bringing them up to speed, retaining people year over year. Most of that isn't what happens. Like that's that's the goal. You would hope for that in that industry, but most of the time it's just constantly new people coming and going.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 所以，你每年可能需要培训一百个新人成为泳池水化学专家。这很难做到。如果你是一家小公司，你可能只需要三个懂水化学的员工轮班工作。但当你是一家大商店时，除非你有一个非常出色的内部培训项目来招募暑期学生、让他们快速上手并年复一年地留住他们，否则情况并非如此。那只是一个理想目标，但大多数时候，只是人员不断地来来去去。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> And usually it's like university students. That's a lot of the swimming pool help in this, especially in the seasonal areas. It's really hard to make a pool chemistry expert out of an 18-year-old kid that's never owned a pool before. And really, they're just doing this cuz they need some dollars in the bank to help with school. And they don't really care about your pool. or at least let's say they care about the party this weekend more than they care about your swimming pool.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 而且通常都是大学生。尤其是在季节性地区，泳池行业的很多帮手都是他们。你很难让一个18岁、从未拥有过泳池的孩子成为泳池化学专家。说真的，他们做这份工只是为了赚点钱应付学业。他们并不真的关心你的泳池。或者至少可以说，相比你的泳池，他们更关心这个周末的派对。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> But you as the owner of the pool, the onus of responsibility to take care of this pool and pay the bills when things aren't going right, that's on you. And so there's a huge huge incentive for you to not have a problem with your water chemistry, maybe more than that kid working behind the counter. And I think that's a little bit of the problem here.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 但作为泳池的主人，照顾好泳池、在出问题时支付账单的责任都在你身上。因此，你有着巨大的动力去确保水质不出问题，这份动力可能比柜台后的那个孩子要大得多。我认为这正是问题的一部分。</p>

            <h2>从人工专家到电脑分析的转变</h2>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> And to add to that, there's it used to be like I'm I've been in this industry long enough that we used to do this old school style and there would be in-house experts and kind of like a pecking order in house of like when there's a problem just ask Bob. Bob solves most of the problems and every now and again Bob can't solve it and then it goes up the chain to Harry and Harry knows people and he's a scientist or whatever. And that's the way it used to be.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 此外，我从事这个行业已经很久了，过去我们都用老派的方式。店里有内部专家，还有一套解决问题的等级次序 (pecking order：此处指公司内部解决问题的层级结构)，比如有问题就找鲍勃。鲍勃能解决大部分问题，偶尔他解决不了，问题就上报给哈里，哈里人脉广，他可能是个科学家什么的。过去就是这样。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Nowadays it's all computer run. You go into the the pool store, you give them their pool water, they just like throw it into the machine and then it just spits out some stuff and they just shove the paper at you and that's it. They don't actually know a thing about water chemistry. They literally are just reading it off the paper to you.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 如今，一切都由电脑操作。你走进泳池用品店，把水样给他们，他们把水样倒进机器里，然后机器打印出一张报告，他们把纸塞给你，就完事了。他们自己其实对水化学一无所知，只是照着纸上的内容念给你听。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> And there is a disadvantage to that because it's going to be telling you to add this stuff and you can't combat the advice they're giving you cuz they're going to say, "Oh, you got to add 3 L of algicide." And you're like, "Why?" And they computer said to do it. They can't give you any reasoning for it.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 这样做有一个缺点，因为报告会告诉你需要添加某些东西，而你无法反驳他们给出的建议。他们会说：“哦，你需要加3升除藻剂。”你问：“为什么？”他们会回答：“电脑说的。”他们给不出任何理由。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> You know, they what it used to be is that like you'd go in and like the old fell working behind the counter there would test your water, tell everything's good, and then he would say something to you like, "Hey, it's going to be raining for the next 2 days here, so don't forget to add some extra chlorine to your pool tonight before you go to sleep." The computer is never going to know that for you, at least in the foreseeable future until AI's really got a good handle on things. That information is being missed from the average pool store.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 你知道吗，过去的情况是，你走进去，柜台后的老师傅会测试你的水质，告诉你一切都好，然后他可能会对你说：“嘿，接下来两天要下雨，别忘了今晚睡觉前给泳池多加点氯。”电脑永远不会为你考虑到这些，至少在可预见的未来，除非人工智能 (AI: Artificial Intelligence) 真正成熟起来。这些信息在普通的泳池用品店里被忽略了。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> So, you see how there's there's room here for improvement. The person that you're talking to isn't really a water care specialist. They don't own a pool. They probably never have. And the the computer programming that they're using can't foresee things. It doesn't know your area. Oh, I see you're you're in the area that's surrounded by golf courses. You might have a problem with phosphates. Not every pool store tests phosphates on every trip because it's a free service testing water. And the phosphate test is usually separate, usually extra.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 所以，你看这里有改进的空间。与你交谈的人并非真正的水质护理专家。他们没有泳池，可能从来没有过。他们使用的电脑程序无法预见未来，也不知道你所在的地区。比如，“哦，我看到你住在高尔夫球场附近，你可能会有磷酸盐 (phosphates：泳池中的一种污染物，是藻类的主要食物来源，可能导致藻类过度繁殖) 过高的问题。”不是每家泳池店每次都会检测磷酸盐，因为水质检测是免费服务，而磷酸盐检测通常是独立的，需要额外收费。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> The AI doesn't know anything about this, right? The computer just spits the information out. If the old fellow working behind the counter could see the area of town that you live in, he might know something. This would be able to help you.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 人工智能对此一无所知，对吧？电脑只是输出信息。如果柜台后的老师傅能看到你居住的区域，他可能会知道一些对你有帮助的事情。</p>

            <h2>结论：并非蓄意欺骗，而是行业困境</h2>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> So, I don't think pool stores are out to rip you off. I think this is just an unfortunate situation where during peak seasons we need unsustainable levels of semiskilled employees within the swimming pool industry. But those jobs can't exist year round. There's not enough work for these people in the offseason. So we can't retain the really good ones long term.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 所以，我不认为泳池用品店是存心想骗你钱。我相信这只是一个不幸的状况：在旺季，泳池行业需要大量不可持续的半熟练员工。但这些工作无法全年存在，淡季时没有足够的工作给这些人做。所以我们无法长期留住那些真正优秀的员工。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> They go off to, you know, get other careers and when once they finish school and seldomly do you keep people within the industry. It's really kind of a young man's game or young person's game in the pool industry and it kind of always has been. Uh so when you find somebody who is good with pool chemistry, let's say your local store has a person who used to wear a lab coat to work every day and they know a lot about pool water chemistry. Go there exclusively. Don't also go to other stores.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 他们毕业后就会去从事其他职业，很少有人会留在泳池行业。这个行业确实一直是年轻人的天下。所以，当你找到一个精通泳池化学的人——比方说，你当地商店有个人每天穿着实验服上班，对水化学非常了解——那就只去他那里。不要再去别的商店了。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> Don't also ask your neighbor Bob about pool chemistry cuz you'll get advice. They they'll give you advice. It's just not good advice. And you have no way to differentiate the good advice from the bad advice. learn about water chemistry. You can't be sold things that you don't need when you really understand more about these halfozen or so parameters that we test and monitor monitor for in pool water and understand that the nature of the pool industry is such that we we have the the eb and flow of this of the you know the seasonality where we're so so busy during the peak seasons and during the middle of the off season there's not enough work for one person to push a broom around.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 也不要问你的邻居鲍勃关于泳池化学的问题，因为你虽然会得到建议，但那不是好的建议。而你无法分辨好建议和坏建议。自己学习水化学知识。当你真正了解我们检测和监控的那七八个参数时，别人就无法卖给你不需要的东西了。要理解泳池行业的本质就是季节性的，有其起伏波动 (eb and flow)，旺季时忙得不可开交，而淡季时，连一个人扫地的活儿都嫌多。</p>
            
            <p class="lang-en"><b>Speaker:</b> So, it's it's a really difficult and challenging industry to accommodate for from a customer service perspective. And I think something that falls through the crack is the quality of care that you receive, especially especially in the seasonal areas.

            <p class="lang-zh"><b>讲述者:</b> 所以，从客户服务的角度来看，这是一个非常困难且富有挑战性的行业。我认为，你得到的服务质量，尤其是在季节性地区，是容易被忽视的一环。如果你觉得这些信息有帮助，请务必点赞本视频并订阅我的YouTube频道。你也可以访问我的网站 swimmingpoolsteve.com。</p>
