            <h1>解密阳明心学到文革的惊人一致：中国文化中的精神自虐机制</h1>

            <h2>引言：从阳明心学到文化大革命的内在逻辑</h2>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Hello everyone, I am Anthony. Welcome to my channel. Today I still want to continue to talk to you about Yangming's philosophy of mind. After three weeks of delay, I think we should end this topic.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 大家好，我是安东尼，欢迎来到我的频道。今天我仍想继续和大家探讨阳明心学。在拖延了三周之后，我想我们应该结束这个话题了。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> From May 24 to June 7, we used four videos in total. This paper discusses the Chinese culture during the Tang and Song dynasties. The crisis encountered, as well as Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism and Yangming's School of Mind, how to innovate through theory, trying to restore and establish the Three Bonds and Five Constant Virtues, the sacredness of the heaven-man system.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 从5月24日到6月7日，我们总共用了四期视频，探讨了唐宋以来的中华文化所遭遇的危机，以及程朱理学和阳明心学如何通过理论创新，试图恢复和确立三纲五常、天人感应体系的神圣性。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Of course we know these efforts, because the defects of traditional thinking have not been overcome, on the contrary, they are regressing in their rational thinking ability. Therefore, it did not really save traditional Chinese culture.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 当然我们知道，这些努力由于未能克服传统思维的缺陷，反而是在理性思辨能力上有所倒退，因此并没有真正拯救中华传统文化。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> So today's show, let's talk about Yangming's philosophy of mind revealed what kind of on the universal laws of the human spirit, and its profound connection with the thinking mode of the Cultural Revolution.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 那么今天的节目，我们就来谈谈阳明心学所揭示出的人类精神的普遍规律，以及它与文化大革命思维模式的深刻关联。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Before the video starts, let me say, if you have anything you want to discuss with me and consulting topics, you can contact my email to make an appointment. So let's get back to today's topic.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 在视频开始前，我想说明一下，如果您有任何希望与我讨论和咨询的话题，可以联系我的邮箱进行预约。现在，让我们回到今天的主题。</p>

            <h2>阳明心学的回顾：激进的内转与保守的核心</h2>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> First, let’s review first content of the June 7 video. At that time we said, Yangming's philosophy of mind, Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism, a more radical version. Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism emphasizes the pursuit of knowledge through the investigation of things. Through the care and understanding of the external natural order, only in this way can we achieve harmony between the individual mind and the principles of nature. But this is still a reluctant "external standard": the principles of heaven are in all things. People need to reflect and introspect in all things.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 首先，我们来回顾一下6月7日视频的内容。当时我们提到，阳明心学是程朱理学的一个更为激进的版本。程朱理学 (Neo-Confucianism: 由程颐、程颢、朱熹等人发展的宋代理学主要流派，强调“理”为宇宙本体) 强调“格物致知”，通过关照和理解外在的自然秩序，才能实现个体内心与天理的和谐。但这仍然保留了一个勉强的“外部标准”：天理存在于万事万物之中，人需要在万事万物中去反思和内省。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> When it comes to Wang Yangming, he directly put all external laws, order, the basis of the objective world, take it back into people’s hearts. Based on people's subjective feelings and self-perception, he emphasized that the universe is nothing but the unfolding of the mind. All the truth, all the truth is in your heart, no need to seek outside.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 而到了王阳明这里，他直接将一切外在的法则、秩序、客观世界的根据，全部收回到人的内心。他以人的主观感受和自我体认为基础，强调宇宙不过是心体的展开，一切真理、一切天理都在你的心中，无需外求。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Compared with the tranquility and tranquility of Song Dynasty Neo-Confucianism, compared with the quiet and indifferent temperament, Yangming's philosophy of mind is full of fantasy, intense, even a combative statement. In Chinese culture, where self-denial and humility are the mainstream, Wang Yangming's passionate, excited and fervent expression looks so unusual.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 相比于宋明理学的宁静淡泊，相比于那种安静、淡然的气质，阳明心学 (School of Mind: 由王阳明创立，主张“心即理”、“知行合一”的儒家哲学) 充满了幻想、激烈，甚至是一种好斗的言说。在以克己、谦卑为主流的中国文化中，王阳明这种充满激情、兴奋和狂热的表达方式，显得如此不同寻常。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> However, once we focus on Wang Yangming's specific way of argumentation, you will find his Way of Thinking and Neo-Confucianism in Song Dynasty, there is no essential difference between "preserving the principles of heaven and eliminating human desires". On the surface, Wang Yangming emphasized you just need to go back to your original intention and do things, you will succeed. This heart naturally has all the truth. No need to seek external verification.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 然而，一旦我们聚焦于王阳明具体的论证方式，你就会发现，他的思维方式与宋代理学的“存天理，灭人欲”并无本质区别。表面上，王阳明强调你只需回归本心去做事，就能成功，这个本心天然地拥有全部真理，无需寻求外部验证。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> However, the content of this original mind, the content of conscience, and the criteria for success, but it is not blank. It does not allow individuals to explore on their own. It was already determined by saints and kings. That is loyalty, filial piety, benevolence and righteousness. You can only exert your initiative and subjectivity, the freedom to implement these values, but there is absolutely no freedom to refute, doubt, or deconstruct them.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 但是，这个本心的内容、良知的内容以及成功的标准，却并非一张白纸，它并不允许个人自行探索，而是早已由圣人、先王所规定好了，那就是忠孝仁义。你只能发挥你的能动性和主体性，去实践这些价值的自由，但绝没有反驳、怀疑或解构它们的自由。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> This reflects the core of Yangming's philosophy of mind, in fact, it is quite conservative, rigid and illusory. And to some extent, towards witchcraft thinking, primitive thinking and mysticism.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 这就反映出，阳明心学的内核其实是相当保守、僵化和虚幻的，并且在某种程度上，走向了巫术思维、原始思维和神秘主义。</p>

            <h2>权威的神秘主义：不可言说的“天理”与不容置疑的“导师”</h2>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Let’s look at a conversation between Wang Yangming and his disciples. Disciple said, there are too many and too diverse books written by Confucian scholars in later generations, may interfere with the learning of the saints. Wang Yangming said: There is a natural law in the human heart. The Book of Saints is just a rough description of the principles of heaven. Just to make it easier for people to understand. Later generations went to write books, it is also a book of saints, a rougher depiction. This is self-analysis, we are getting further and further away from the true principles.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 我们来看一段王阳明和弟子的对话。弟子说，后世儒者写的书太多太杂，可能会干扰圣人之学。王阳明说：人的心中自有天理，圣人之书只是对天理的粗略描摹，只是为了方便人理解。后人再去写书，也是对圣人之书的又一番粗略描摹，这样自我分析下去，我们就离真正的天理越来越远了。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Wang Yangming's words, it seems to emphasize that the works of saints cannot exhaust the truth. Need self-realization. But he was just trying to avoid using public reason to test the legitimacy of those laws. He put all the text logic and argument are considered limited, will Tianli, it all comes down to the inexpressible spirit. But this way of thinking is very mystical.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 王阳明的这番话，看似在强调圣人的著作不能穷尽真理，需要自我体悟，但他其实只是想回避用公共理性去检验那些法则的正当性。他把一切的文本逻辑和论证都视为有限的，将“天理”全部归结为不可言说的精神。但这种思维方式是非常神秘主义的。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> We say, once the public nature of language and knowledge is denied, then this knowledge power then quietly transferred to those "psychics" or the "Revelator", for example, Wang Yangming himself. Because this knowledge only in tune with the inner experiences of these psychics themselves, it is unspeakable. Only through mysterious induction and enlightenment. This creates a authority structures that cannot be questioned or confirmed.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 我们说，一旦语言和知识的公共性被否定，那么这种知识权力便悄悄地转移到了那些“通灵者”或“启示者”身上，例如王阳明本人。因为这种知识只与这些通灵者自身的内在体验相契合，它是不可言说的，只能通过神秘的感应和顿悟来获得。这就创造出了一种无法被质询和确证的权威结构。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> In the dialogue between Wang Yangming and his disciples, we also often see that kind of didactic and authoritarian tone. For example, there is a dialogue in the "Chuan Xi Lu", it is said that Wang Yangming had a disciple named Meng Yuan. This person likes a good reputation. Maybe I just like to show off myself. Wang Yangming often criticized him for this. One day I just finished criticizing, another friend, I came to report to Wang Yangming my recent experience in self-cultivation. After listening to this, Meng Yuan said, this is also my experience before. Wang Yangming, your illness has recurred. Meng Yuan is a little anxious, I want to make a few excuses. Wang Yangming said, your problem has come back again. Then Wang Yangming said, this is your big disease. Like in a small piece of land, planted a big tree. All the rain and nutrients, all of them were absorbed by this big tree. As a result, you can't grow other crops. This tree must be cut down by the roots to grow good crops. Otherwise, no matter how you farm, in the end, it nourishes this big tree.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 在王阳明与弟子的对话中，我们也经常能看到那种说教式的、威权主义的口吻。例如，《传习录》 (Chuan Xi Lu: 王阳明与其弟子的语录和书信集，是阳明心学的核心著作) 中有这样一段对话，说王阳明有个弟子叫孟源，这个人好名，或许就是喜欢炫耀自己。王阳明经常因此批评他。有一天刚批评完，另一位朋友来向王阳明汇报自己近期的修养心得。孟源听完后说，这也是我以前的体会。王阳明说，你的病又复发了。孟源有点着急，想辩解几句。王阳明说，你的毛病又来了。接着王阳明说，这是你的大病根，就像在一小块田地里，种了一棵大树，所有的雨露养分，全都被这棵大树吸走了，结果就长不出别的庄稼。这棵树必须连根砍掉，才能种出好的庄稼，否则你再怎么耕种，最终都是在滋养这棵大树。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> We saw this disciple named Meng Yuan, there is an urge to show myself, maybe with a hint of showing off. He is eager to share his experience with others. In modern educational concepts, it's the most normal thing. But in Wang Yangming's view, this is selfish behavior. As long as you like a good reputation, trying to win praise from others, this is a sign that selfish desires have not been completely eliminated. The teacher criticized you, you're trying to defend yourself. You still want to maintain your image. This shows that you are seriously ill.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 我们看到这个叫孟源的弟子，有种表现自己的冲动，或许带点炫耀。他急于和别人分享自己的心得，在现代的教育观念里，这是再正常不过的事情。但在王阳明看来，这就是私心作祟。只要你好名，试图博取别人的称赞，这就是私欲没有被彻底根除的标志。老师批评你，你还试图为自己辩解，还想维护自己的形象，这说明你病得不轻。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> This conversation easily reminds us of in many Chinese families, companies, or Chinese studies classes and schools, leaders, teachers and parents I like to criticize a person for being self-righteous. Always making excuses for yourself. If a person tries to defend himself, this further proves that I am such a person. But there's a very strange thing here. That is the meaning of "self-righteousness" in Chinese culture. Why has it become a derogatory term?</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 这段对话很容易让我们联想到，在很多中国的家庭、公司，或者国学班、学校里，领导、老师和父母都喜欢批评一个人“自以为是”、“总为自己找借口”。如果一个人试图为自己辩解，这就进一步证明了我就是这样一个人。但这里有一个非常奇怪的事情，就是“自以为是”在中国文化里的含义，为什么会变成一个贬义词？</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> I think it comes from Mencius. It means a person thinks he is right. Unable to accept other people's opinions with an open mind. However, people can only understand the world from their own perspective. Even if you start accepting other people's opinions now, think you made a mistake, that's you now. Criticizing your past self. You are essentially self-righteous. So, opinionated, it's not a correctable mistake at all. It is the basis of all human psychological activities.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 我想它出自孟子，意思是一个人认为自己是对的，不能虚心接受别人的意见。然而，人只能从自己的角度去理解世界。就算你现在开始接受别人的意见，认为自己犯了错误，那也是现在的你，在批评过去的你，你本质上还是在“自以为是”。所以，“自以为是”根本不是一个可以被纠正的错误，它是一切人类心理活动的基础。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Since "self-righteousness" is absolutely inevitable, then Chinese culture, why should it be suppressed as a disease? In fact, this reflects the Chinese cultural assumption that the self itself is the source of error and sin. As long as you try to defend, it means that your heart is not calm enough and sincere enough. He doesn't mean to correct specific mistakes made by oneself, it is to correct one's own self. But because of the self, it is impossible to truly eliminate it. So it cultivated, it can only be a self that always disagrees with itself. A kind of surrendering everything to external authority, immature state.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 既然“自以为是”是绝对无法避免的，那么中国文化为什么要把它当作一种病症来加以压制呢？这其实反映了中国文化的一种假设，即“自我”本身就是错误和罪恶的来源。只要你试图辩护，就说明你内心不够平静、不够真诚。它要纠正的不是人所犯下的具体错误，而是要纠正人的“自我”本身。但由于自我是不可能被真正消灭的，所以它培养的，只能是一种永远与自身不合的自我，一种将一切都臣服于外部权威的、不成熟的状态。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Same reason, making excuses for yourself shouldn't be a mistake. If the person's reasons for defending himself are not correct, you can point out the error in this reasoning. But many people criticized, in fact, the motivation itself is to defend oneself. As long as you try to defend yourself, you're making a mistake yourself. This is of course a very profound and secret discipline.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 同理，“为自己找借口”也不应该是一种错误。如果一个人为自己辩护的理由不正确，你可以指出这个推理的错误。但很多人批评的，其实是“为自己辩护”这个动机本身，只要你试图为自己辩护，你本身就犯了错误。这当然是一种非常深刻而隐秘的规训。</p>

            <h2>修养之道：作为精神自虐的“功夫”</h2>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> In addition, we can also find Wang Yangming likes to use a person's selfish desires, metaphorically a disease or weed, it must be completely eliminated. This metaphor itself is worth pondering. For example, there is also such a passage in the "Chuan Xi Lu", a conversation between Wang Yangming and Xiao Hui. One day Xiao Hui said, Teacher, I think my selfishness is too strong. What should I do if I often can’t control myself? Wang Yangming said, you think you are good to yourself, just to make the eyes see more beautiful things, let your mouth eat more delicious food, make your body comfortable. This is totally wrong.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 此外，我们还可以发现，王阳明喜欢用一个人的私欲，比喻成一种病根或者杂草，必须被彻底根除。这个比喻本身就值得玩味。例如，《传习录》中还有这样一段王阳明和萧惠的对话。一天萧惠说，老师，我觉得我私心太重了，常常管不住自己，该怎么办？王阳明说，你以为的对自己好，无非是让眼睛多看些美色，让嘴巴多吃些美味，让身体安逸舒适，这完全是错误的。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Really for yourself, not the pursuit of sensual enjoyment, but let your five senses obey the guidance of heaven. That is, do not look at what is indecent, do not listen to what is indecent. Your heart is your true self. You are the master of your body. But you need to always protect this heart, be careful and vigilant. Don't let the colorful things distract your vision. Otherwise you will lose money. As long as there is the slightest indecent thought, it's like being cut by a knife. The pain is like being pricked by a needle. Until you clear that thought completely.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 真正的为自己好，不是追求感官的享乐，而是让你的五官都听从天理的指引，也就是“非礼勿视，非礼勿听”。你的心才是你真正的自己，是你身体的主人。但你需要时时保护这颗心，小心警惕，不要让五光十色的东西分了你的心神，否则你就会亏损。只要有丝毫非礼的念头，就像被刀割了一样，像被针刺了一样的痛，直到你把那个念头彻底扫除为止。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> The metaphors used by Wang Yangming are very distinctive. For example, cutting the grass and eradicating the roots, cutting with a knife and pricking with a needle. These are easy to associate with physical pain experience. If it is said that it is the method of cultivation of Zhu Lixue, it is to study things in nature to gain knowledge. Then the method of Yangming's philosophy of mind, it promotes a pathological form of self-censorship. And mental self-abuse. A person should not only be aware of what he has done, be more afraid of the thoughts and impulses you may have. We must “nip problems in the bud”. Once the idea comes, the body will lose. It's like being cut by a knife or stabbed by a needle. Must be removed.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 王阳明使用的比喻非常有特色，例如“割草除根”、“刀割针刺”，这些都容易让人联想到身体的疼痛体验。如果说程朱理学的修养方法，是去自然中“格物致知”，那么阳明心学的方法，则推崇一种病态的自我审查和精神自虐。一个人不但要察觉到自己做过的事，更要害怕自己可能产生的念头和冲动，必须“防患于未然”。念头一旦产生，本体就会有所亏损，就像被刀割针刺一样，必须被清除。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Of course, the human body does not feel severe pain after all. Wang Yangming meant to say, you have to examine yourself, any unethical thoughts, then feel intense shame, fear, guilt, and self-blame. This kind of mental self-abuse should reach the intensity of physical pain. You have to keep proving that you are a good person. Always feel guilty, nervous and cautious. But such people are indeed more easily manipulated by authority. Because he completely lost his mental boundaries. Became a an existence that can be checked at will by authority and adults.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 当然，人的身体毕竟不会感到剧痛，王阳明的意思是说，你要审视自己任何不合乎道德的念头，然后感到强烈的羞耻、恐惧、内疚和自责。这种精神上的自虐，要达到身体疼痛的强度。你必须不断地证明自己是个好人，时时感到内疚、紧张和谨慎。但这样的人，也确实更容易被权威所操控，因为他完全丧失了精神的边界，变成了一个可以被权威和大人随意检查的存在。</p>

            <h2>政治隐喻：“中国犹一人”与思想改造</h2>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> In "University Question", Wang Yangming expounded his understanding of adults and children. He said: The adults, the one who regards heaven, earth and all things as one. Such an adult, able to see the whole world as one family, China as a Person. Everyone is equal, it's just part of this person. If someone tries to differentiate himself from others, trying to maintain your boundaries, then this is the little man.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 在《大学问》中，王阳明阐述了他对“大人”和“小人”的理解。他说：大人者，以天地万物为一体者也。这样的大人，能够视天下为一家，中国为一人。每一个人，都只是这个人的一部分。如果有人试图将自己与他人区分开来，试图维持自己的边界，那么这就是小人。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Wang Yangming believed, if a person cannot eliminate selfish desires, then even if he has an adult heart, it will also look like a little person. Even if a person has a mean heart, but if he could not be blinded by his own desires, then he is a grown-up.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 王阳明认为，如果一个人不能根除私欲，那么就算他有大人的心，也会显得像个小人；即使一个人有小人之心，但如果他能不被自己的欲望蒙蔽，那么他就是个大人。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> On the surface, Wang Yangming is elevating the individual. It seems to emphasize that everyone can be Yao and Shun. Everyone's heart, there is a person who understands the universe. It seems to be a kind of universalism with humanistic care. But in fact, this hides a highly authoritarian logic. That is the key difference between people. It is whether you can eliminate selfish desires. Then let another person change your mind, help you get rid of selfish desires, it's not just not harmful to you. It's for your own good. It is to punish past mistakes, prevent future ones, and cure diseases and save lives. Is helping you restore your original conscience. If you fight against it, that just shows that your selfish desire is too deep. I need treatment more.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 表面上看，王阳明是在抬高个体，似乎在强调“人人皆可为尧舜”，每个人的心中，都存有一个通达宇宙的大人，这似乎是一种带有人文关怀的普遍主义。但实际上，这隐藏着一种高度威权的逻辑。即人与人之间关键的差别，就在于你是否能够根除私欲。那么，让另一个人来改造你的思想，帮你去除私欲，就不仅不是对你的伤害，反而是为你好，是“惩前毖后，治病救人”，是帮助你恢复你本来的良知。如果你对此进行反抗，那恰恰说明你的私欲太深，更需要治疗。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Therefore, Yangming's philosophy of mind seems to have an optimistic attitude towards human nature. But in fact, it is just to make people become a objects that can be transformed and destroyed by external means, provides a theoretical basis for intervening and disciplining others. Wang Yangming's words "China is still one person", more than just a rhetoric and metaphor. It just conveyed a very dangerous political idea. His vision for society, not a community of difference and diversity, it is a need for unity of thought, a “body” that acts in unison. Every individual, just like a cell in this body. And regard the whole country as one person. This means, someone needs to represent this person's mind. Other body organs, all must obey the arrangement and planning of this brain. This way of thinking, of course, it has also profoundly influenced contemporary China.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 因此，阳明心学看似对人性抱持一种乐观的态度，但实际上，它恰恰为把人变成一个可以被外部手段改造和摧毁的对象，为干预和规训他人提供了理论基础。王阳明“中国犹一人”的说法，也不仅仅是一种修辞和比喻，它恰恰传达了一种非常危险的政治观念。他所设想的社会，不是一个差异和多元的共同体，而是一个需要思想统一、步调一致的“身体”。每一个个体，就像这个身体里的一个细胞。而把整个国家看作一个人，这就意味着，需要有一个人来代表这个人的心智，其他的身体器官，都必须服从这个大脑的安排和规划。这种思维方式，当然也深刻地影响了当代中国。</p>

            <h2>历史的回响：从宋明理学到延安整风</h2>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> For example, Hunan is regarded as the center of Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties. As early as the Southern Song Dynasty, Hunan formed the largest school of Neo-Confucianism. Therefore, it can be said that it is the most orthodox and one of the most conservative regions. This of course profoundly influenced and shaped Mao Zedong's way of thinking.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 例如，湖南被视为宋明理学的中心。早在南宋时期，湖南就形成了理学的最大流派，因此可以说是最正统、也最保守的地区之一。这当然也深刻地影响和塑造了毛泽东的思维方式。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> We know, Yang Changji was familiar with Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism and Yangming's School of Mind. He was not only Mao Zedong's teacher, also Mao Zedong's father-in-law. In the previous video, we have mentioned many times, the letter from Mao Zedong to Li Jinxi in his youth. In the letter, he expressed his desire to change China. Such as parliament, constitution, president, cabinet, military, industry, education, etc., it's all details. What really matters is the origin. That is, a person's inner morality and ideological awareness. This great source, it is within everyone's heart. This is almost the same as the saying in Lu Wang's School of Mind: "My mind is the universe." It is completely connected.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 我们知道，杨昌济精通程朱理学和阳明心学，他不仅是毛泽东的老师，也是毛泽东的岳父。在之前的视频里，我们多次提到毛泽东青年时期写给黎锦熙的信。信中，他表达了自己改造中国的愿望，认为议会、宪法、总统、内阁、军事、实业、教育等等，都只是细枝末节，真正重要的是“大本大源”，也就是一个人的内心道德和思想觉悟。这个大本大源，就在每个人的心中。这与陆王心学的“我心即是宇宙”的说法，几乎是完全贯通的。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Once this universal truth is seen as common to everyone, it's just that some people are temporarily blocked. Then "I will help you restore the truth", it becomes to others reasons for ideological correction and cleansing. Mao Zedong then believed, you can use the great source as your call, to stir up the hearts of all people. Once the hearts of the people of the world are mobilized, then everything will be accomplished. Then conversely, the reason why the masses do not act, it is not because of objective environment or structural constraints. It's because their awareness is too low and their selfish desires are too strong. So they need a "preacher" or "prophet" to wake them up.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 一旦这个普遍的真理被看作是每个人共通的，只是有些人暂时被蒙蔽了，那么“我来帮你恢复真理”，就成了对他人进行思想纠正和清洗的理由。毛泽东进而认为，可以以大本大源为号召，去鼓动天下万众之心，一旦天下之心都被动员起来，那么一切事情就都会迎刃而解。那么反过来说，群众之所以不行动，不是因为客观环境或结构性的制约，而是因为他们的觉悟太低，私心太重，所以需要一个“传教士”或“先知”来唤醒他们。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> The Yan'an Rectification Movement, this was the first large-scale practice of this kind of thought reform. "How the Red Sun Rises", the details of this transformation are recorded. First, intellectuals should check the documents, write a reflective note, keep checking your history, digging into your own private thoughts. As we gradually dig deeper into our true self, learners generally develop a sense of guilt. I think that in addition to reading a few more books, it is of no value to the Party and the people. And my own selfish thoughts will harm the revolution. It's a sinful thing.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 延安整风运动 (Yan'an Rectification Movement: 1942-1945年中共在延安进行的思想和政治运动，确立了毛泽东的绝对领导地位) ，就是这种思想改造的第一次大规模实践。《红太阳是怎样升起的》一书，就记录了这种改造的细节。首先，知识分子要审查文件，写反思笔记，不断地检查自己的历史，深挖自己的私心杂念。随着对自我真实面貌的不断深挖，学习者普遍会产生一种负罪感，认为自己除了多读了几本书，对党和人民毫无价值，而自己的私心杂念还会危害革命，是罪恶的东西。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> The second is the pressure from the group. Everyone criticizes himself, we also need to expose and criticize others, you also need to accept criticism from others. These, they all appear in the name of caring for each other. For example, leading cadres will visit in person, guiding the parties with great care, reflect on your own thoughts and historical issues. This often makes the parties very moved, so I confessed my bad thoughts. If the person refuses to reflect deeply, so based on the purpose of curing diseases and saving lives, the leaders will immediately hold a struggle session, mobilize all the friends and acquaintances of the person involved, to conduct face-to-face disclosure. Under this high pressure, the vast majority surrendered. They often use mental self-abuse, reveal all your thoughts and history.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 其次是来自群体的压力。每个人自我批评，还需要揭发和批评别人，也需要接受别人的批评。而这些，都以相互关怀的名义出现。例如，领导干部会亲自登门，非常耐心地引导当事人，反思自己的思想和历史问题，这往往让当事人非常感动，于是坦白了自己的不良思想。如果当事人拒绝深刻反思，那么本着“治病救人”的目的，领导就会立即召开斗争会，动员当事人所有的朋友、熟人，来进行面对面的揭发。在这种高压之下，绝大多数人都缴械投降了，他们往往会用精神自虐的方式，交代出自己所有的思想和历史。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> For example, Zhu Ming, a female student at the Central Party School, I wrote down this reflection note. She put her past aesthetics, conversation, ambitions, and work interests, even childhood experiences, all of them are included in the framework of "class struggle", self-flagellation. Because I grew up in an exploiting class family. So now the words and actions feel, even a subconscious reaction, they may all be the legacy of the old social culture.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 例如，中央党校的一位女学员朱明，就写下了这样的反思笔记。她把自己过去的审美、谈吐、志向、工作兴趣，乃至童年经历，都纳入“阶级斗争”的框架进行自我鞭笞。因为自己出身于剥削阶级家庭，所以现在的一言一行，乃至潜意识的反应，都可能是旧社会文化的遗毒。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> For example, she reflected on how she had envied Zhou Enlai and others. I have thought about taking a car and staying in a big hotel. This is the pursuit of vanity. She reflects on herself, motivation for joining the Russian Department of Yan'an University, it's actually impure. On the surface, I said it was for better learning. I just want to be a diplomat. Never realized, I should honestly obey the organization's arrangements. Experience in childhood, she recalled the stories she had heard, they are all fairy tales like princes and princesses, I haven't heard any stories about workers and farmers. In terms of aesthetics, she said she liked Turgenev better. Tolstoy's works, I like Western classical art. On socialist literature, for example, How the Steel Was Tempered, not very interested. Zhu Ming's self-reflection is full of such self-insults. Finally admitted, even my blood carries the elements of the exploiting class, it's dirty.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 比如，她反思自己曾羡慕过周恩来等人，有过坐汽车、住大旅馆的想法，这是追求虚荣。她反思自己，加入延安大学俄文系的动机其实不纯，表面上说是为了更好地学习，其实只是想当个外交家，从未认识到，自己应该老老实实服从组织的安排。童年的经历，她回忆起听到的故事，都是王子公主之类的童话，没听过什么工农的故事。在审美方面，她说自己更喜欢屠格涅夫、托尔斯泰的作品，喜欢西方的古典艺术，而对社会主义文学，例如《钢铁是怎样炼成的》，则不太感兴趣。朱明的自我反思充满了这样的自我侮辱，最后承认，连自己的血液里都带有剥削阶级的成分，是肮脏的。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> For this kind of ideological transformation, Xie Juezai, then member of the Northwest Bureau, I quoted Wang Yangming's words, asking Party members to follow Mao Zedong's teachings, eradicate all distractions from your mind. He said that transforming oneself is like turning raw meat into cooked meat. Both boiling and steaming, overcooked is not considered cooked. It will take a long time to train, always be vigilant.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 对于这种思想改造，时任西北局委员的谢觉哉，就引用王阳明的话，要求党员们遵照毛泽东的教导，根除自己头脑中一切的杂念。他说，改造自己就像把生肉变成熟肉，既要煮，也要蒸，煮过了头也不算熟，需要长久的锻炼，时刻保持警惕。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Once we have some understanding of Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism, you will understand, this kind of thought reform method, it didn’t come out of thin air. It was just that Mao Zedong institutionalized this way of thinking. It is concrete.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 一旦我们对宋明理学有所了解，你就会明白，这种思想改造的方法，并非凭空而来，它只是毛泽东将这种思维方式制度化、具体化了。</p>

            <h2>普遍规律：绝望、狂热与世俗化神学</h2>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> From a broader perspective, whether it is Yangming's philosophy of mind or the Cultural Revolution, in fact, it reflects such a universal laws of the human spirit. That is when a person, or when the spirit of a nation falls into despair and powerlessness, his conventional rationality can no longer understand and respond to reality, increasingly stretched. Then the mental state of the person concerned will be contrary to his normal state. From nothingness and loss, sudden change to intense excitement, euphoria, and frenzy. He will suddenly become very confident about everything, it seems like I have gained infinite energy. But this confidence does not seem to be based on reason. It is a mysterious subjective experience, or some kind of fantasy and self-hypnosis. On the surface, it looks full of vitality and upbeat. It's actually a deep despair.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 从一个更广阔的视角来看，无论是阳明心学还是文化大革命，其实都反映了这样一种人类精神的普遍规律。即当一个人，或一个民族的精神陷入绝望和无力时，他常规的理性已经无法理解和回应现实，日益捉襟见肘，那么当事人的精神状态就会与其正常状态相反，从虚无和失落，骤然转变为强烈的兴奋、欣快和狂热。他会突然对一切都变得非常有信心，似乎获得了无限的能量。但这种信心似乎并非基于理性，而是一种神秘的主观体验，或某种幻想和自我催眠。表面上看，它充满了活力和昂扬，实际上却是深深的绝望。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> As in this video on December 10, 2023, mentioned, May Fourth Movement, intellectuals generally advocate the kind of moralism, and top-down enlightenment. Hopefully by changing people's hearts, changing thoughts, the way of mass movement, to quickly transform China. They celebrate the power of ideas, precisely because Chinese culture at that time, faced with unprecedented challenges from external culture.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 就像在2023年12月10日的这期视频中提到的，五四运动的知识分子普遍主张那种道德主义和自上而下的启蒙，希望通过改变人心、改变思想、群众运动的方式，来快速地改造中国。他们颂扬观念的力量，恰恰是因为当时的中国文化，面临着外部文化前所未有的挑战。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> For example, China before the Cultural Revolution, it is also in a serious social crisis and institutional failure. But the ideology of the Cultural Revolution, but the hope for change is growing, relying on the enthusiasm of subjective will and firm belief, like a revolution in the depths of the soul, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 例如，文革前的中国，也正处于严重的社会危机和制度失灵之中。但文革的意识形态，却将改变的希望越来越寄托于主观意志的热情和坚定的信念，如“灵魂深处闹革命”、“斗私批修”。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> Certainly, this is a phenomenon common to all human beings. For example, Russia before 1917, it was an empire with political decay and sharp social contradictions. In this desperate state, the Bolshevik Revolutionary Narrative, it provided the Russians with a historical theology. Although, they call themselves internationalists and Marxists. But in the kernel, Russian Messianism, believe, the Russian spirit has a special historical mission. It is to bring Europe and the world, freed from the evil and corruption of capitalism.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 当然，这是一种全人类共通的现象。例如，1917年前的俄国，是一个政治腐朽、社会矛盾尖锐的帝国。在这种绝望的状态下，布尔什维克的革命叙事，就为俄国人提供了一种历史神学。尽管，他们自称是国际主义者和马克思主义者，但在内核里，却是俄罗斯的弥赛亚主义 (Messianism: 救世主信仰，相信一个特定民族或个人被赋予了拯救世界的特殊使命)，相信俄罗斯精神具有特殊的历史使命，就是要将欧洲和世界，从资本主义的罪恶和腐败中解放出来。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> For example, Weimar Republic, also born in a social turmoil, the Age of Order Collapse. The freedom and rule of law promised by modern enlightenment rationality have become weak. The public is beginning to dislike the diversity and compromise of democracy, but I want a strong decision, putting hope in a noble and sacred national will, let's change all this quickly. German National Spirit, depicted as a polluted sacred being, a strong cleansing by the leaders is needed, to restore purity.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 再比如，魏玛共和国 (Weimar Republic: 1918-1933年间的德国，因政治动荡、经济危机和社会分裂而最终被纳粹取代)，同样诞生于一个社会动荡、秩序崩溃的年代。现代启蒙理性所承诺的自由和法治变得虚弱无力，公众开始厌恶民主的多元和妥协，而想要一个强有力的决断，将希望寄托于一个高贵而神圣的民族意志，来迅速地改变这一切。德意志的民族精神，被描绘成一个被污染了的神圣存在，需要领袖强有力的清洗，来恢复其纯洁性。</p>

            <p class="lang-en"><b>Anthony:</b> As Carl Schmidt believed, all important concepts in modern state theory, these are all secularized theological concepts. When a society cannot find a modern rational order, he often resorts to more fanatical and radical concepts, to break the conventional mechanism, and give it justice and necessity. These concepts are not necessarily religious, it may appear secular, such as people, leaders, class struggle, etc. But their commonality is unquestionable. Not for discussion.</p>
            <p class="lang-zh"><b>安东尼:</b> 正如卡尔·施密特 (Carl Schmitt: 德国法学家和政治理论家，其思想对威权主义有重要影响) 所认为的，现代国家理论中所有重要的概念，都是世俗化了的神学概念。当一个社会找不到现代的理性秩序时，他往往会诉诸于一些更为狂热和激进的观念，来打破常规的机制，并赋予其正义性和必然性。这些观念不一定是宗教的，它可能以世俗的面貌出现，例如人民、领袖、阶级斗争等等，但它们的共同点就是不容置疑，不容讨论。</p>
